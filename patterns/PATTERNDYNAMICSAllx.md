An Integral Permaculture

I’ve practiced and taught permaculture, at times intensively, for most of the last
fifteen years. In that time my perspective on permaculture has changed and evolved,
as has permaculture itself. If at times in this chapter I am critical of elements of
permaculture, it is not to be negative or to lessen the importance of the discipline, but
to examine the points of pain and disappointment that that have lead me to new
understandings and new directions. The same should be true for the movement
itself, and I’m writing here with this in mind.

Permaculture was my portal into the world of sustainability and environmentalism.
Before I encountered permaculture and the realization that the planet (and humanity
with it) was heading for trouble, I lived with a kind of optimism, a sense of
acceptance and a general, if ignorant, ease about the world I lived in. Permaculture
changed all that. I can remember the first time I heard the word, oblivious to the fact
that this one little utterance would radically change my view of the world and define
my existence for at least the next twenty years. I was tree planting with a crew of
mostly fringe dwellers, alternative folks and other students in remote, mountain
wilderness in Western Canada. Simon, a soft spoken fellow with long hair and an
eagle feather held in place with a thin leather headband, introduced me to the fateful
word. We sat on a log and ate lunch out of dusty rucksacks. I told him about my
impending trip to see my father in Australia. He told me I should look into a
Tasmanian called Bill Mollison who taught a way of sustainable living called
‘permaculture’. He explained the Willing Workers on Organic Farms (WWOOF)
network- living by volunteering on other people’s organic farms for food and board,
and his encounters with permaculture in the Pacific north-west. At that point I don’t
think I really understood what permaculture was, but it settled in the back of my mind
as an environmental curiosity, a talisman as exotic as the fellow who introduced me
to it.

I realize now with reflection, that the story of my experience in permaculture is
essentially my journey through that environmental portal to a world of somewhat
painful awakening and increasing sensitivity to the environmental and social disaster
humanity was perpetrating. After that, I undertook a long, determined and often
difficult attempt to make permaculture work as a method of sustainable living. Finally,
there was a gradual spiralling back around to a renewed acceptance and
appreciation for the society I was born to, our time in history and the wide world with
all its foibles and wonders, ugliness and beauty, sustainability and unsustainability.

From Sensitivity to Integration

I’m telling the story here, because I think this renewed acceptance of the world has
led to a much more effective approach to sustainability and a renewed appreciation
and passion for permaculture. I think of it as the shift from sensitivity to integration:
from the heartfelt despair, anxiety and sometimes anger inherent in environmental
awareness to a more full appreciation and confidence in the holistic intelligence at
work in our evolving universe and the ways we can work through this towards real
and sustainable futures. The rest of this chapter is spent on an exploration of this
shift and the nature of what I term an integral approach. This is largely based on the
work of American philosopher Ken Wilber.

Making the shift allowed me to see that much of my past activity was driven by
anxiety and despair, an unrealistic approach to changing the world, and a kind of
guilt born of participating in what I thought of as a destructive society. My growing
sensitivity generated a lot of turmoil and energy. It was like a rising storm, and I
realise now that I was exposed with little shelter and few beacons to safety. Despite
the trials and the dangers, it was an essential process. I think it’s a process many
others are going through and will go through: an increasingly common cultural
pattern as the sustainability challenges mount. It is worth bringing awareness to this
process and to making it safer and easier for others to negotiate. From where I stand
now, this aspect of people care is every bit as essential as growing food, designing
properties and re-localising economies.

Tagari Farm

When I arrived in north Queensland Australia, I found a copy of the Permaculture
Designers Manual by this fellow Bill Mollison on my father’s bookshelf. It was
fascinating. I was interested in design as I’d studied architecture after my

undergraduate degree in literature, but the conventional design disciplines paled in
comparison to sustainable design using wind and water, earth, plants and animals. I
found a weekend introductory course and shortly after that I drove down the east
coast of Australia to Tyalgum in northern New South Wales for my foundation ten-
day Permaculture Design Certificate course at the Permaculture Institute with Bill
Mollison himself.

At Tagari Farm Bill indoctrinated some 50 of us into permaculture through a ten day
process of story, vision, knowledge and ecological understanding, passion, humour
and genius that I’ve never encountered since. Not only that, but the amazing people I
met on the PDC inspired me and made me feel like I’d found my community and my
life’s work. I was hooked. The day on patterns in particular gripped me in a way that I
couldn’t quite describe. I was going to be a permaculturist. A few months later I
arrived back at the Permaculture Institute determined to take up a licence to do a
sustainable forestry project as a participant in what was loosely described as the
Tagari share farm.

Tagari Farm was an interesting and exciting place. Bill would draw amazing folks
from all over the world. Waves of permaculture design course participants would
wash in and out, and over time a small group of people assembled to take up
licences on the share farm. I say assembled, because beyond an explanation of the
share farm concept in the course or the occasional loose invitation, there was very
little supporting structure for actually joining the share farm or getting a licence. One
simply had to make one’s way as best one could. Despite the obstacles and lack of
support, the group that was to form our period of experimentation at the
Permaculture Institute’s Tagari Farm, took shape. Up to a dozen of us were
developing projects in market gardening, tropical fruits, fowls, rabbits, aquaculture,
earth works, permaculture training, design, forestry, tree crops, bamboo, tours,
education and publishing.

The Tyranny of Structurelessness

In retrospect, this experiment couldn’t have ended in anything but failure. Although
most of us lived nearby, off the farm, the social dimension to our lives there was
intense and our project coordination dysfunctional. There was an implied
understanding that all we needed to make permaculture work was our shared ethics,
principles, practices and a rugged commitment to earth care. This belief was held up
as an almost magical elixir for organizational development. This strategy proved
woefully inadequate and things degenerated badly over time. Attempts by some of
us to organize ourselves and to create some structures and processes were not
supported. We suffered from the ‘tyranny of structurelessness’: a rejection of all
structure in social affairs because the existing structures in our society were seen to
be controlling and destructive.

I can remember one quite funny, but at the time quite terrifying, episode where a few
of us gathered around Bill’s kitchen table to put forward a proposal from some of the
share farm licensees. A dark look crept over his face as he read it, and with the full
force of his personality (which for anyone who has felt it, will, I think, be counted as
one of their more memorable experiences), proceeded to challenge our initiative as
an attempt to take over the functions of the Permaculture Institute. Function, or a
lack of it, was exactly why we were there, but there was obviously no arguing the
point, so we retracted the submission, opened a bottle of port and listen to Bill tell us
stories until late into the night.

I have observed similar struggles with structurelessness in many environmental
projects and sustainability experiments over the ensuing years. Inevitably the lack of
effective organization leads to breakdown in the group and ends in chronic
dysfunction or complete failure. I liken this to trying to operate your body without any
bones. The end of our few years at the Permaculture Institute was punctuated by the
tragic suicide of one of our number. Almost all of us left shortly after that devastating
event. Previous and subsequent groups suffered more of less the same fate. What
was Tagari Farm now stands overgrown, empty and abandoned to this day. In my
view, all the good effort and resources put into earth care were largely undone by a
failure of people care. A project meant to be a leading example of permaculture
practice suffered the ignominy and irony of being unsustainable by virtue of not
developing its own stated second ethic.

The Burn-Out Mill

Thus began my process of facing up to the unhelpful myths and dogmas of
permaculture. Rather than rejecting permaculture outright or, alternatively, hiding
these truths, I wanted to explore what it would take to get permaculture theory to
translate into effective practice at the community level. Could it be used to
demonstrate a sustainable way of living? Was it possible for the theory to translate
into reality? Could the claims, especially the more grandiose claims made by some
in permaculture, be supported? Could we live up to these expectations? Could it be
used to transform our society in practical and enduring ways? Were we fooling
ourselves?

I think it is fair to say that our critics have keyed in on this lack of effective practical
demonstration: initial enthusiasm and over-exposure all too often giving way to
unsustainable outcomes. Despite the large number of permaculture adherents, in the
wealthy Western countries at least, where permaculture is the designated
sustainability strategy, successful practical demonstrations beyond the of the level of
the family property are relatively rare. The ones that do persist are often short lived,
sometimes only cosmetic variations on mainstream living, or obviously
unsustainable. Many entering permaculture are underwhelmed when they go looking
for the examples to meet their expectations. Then there is the grim battle in chronic
dysfunction to make permaculture projects work though unsustainable means. This
is another unfortunate pattern in environmental and sustainability work in general
and permacultue in particular. I call it the ‘burn out mill’. Whether we acknowledge it
or not, we are famous for it: individuals burning out to prop up something that just
isn’t sustainable in-and-of-itself. Or, using wave after wave of people recently
indoctrinated, motivated more often by despair than by hope, to work in permaculture
projects where their energy is consumed and their expectations go unmet. These
people then either return to conventional life or, ignoring a dissonance between
theory and practice, perpetuate the myths in their own permaculture work.

I’m pointing out these negative aspects of permaculture, not because I think all
permaculturists practice them, or that initially they can entirely be avoided, but
because they are elements of our discipline that lack integrity. We should

acknowledge them and reform them if we are to make a more effective contribution
to sustainable transition. The end cannot justify the means. We cannot, on an
ongoing basis, demonstrate sustainability in unsustainable ways, interpret this as
success and expect to be taken seriously. Here, I do need to pay tribute to those
practitioners who do have the enduring functional examples and to acknowledge all
their hard work and commitment to getting it right.

Permaforest

In spite of my experiences at Tagari Farm, or perhaps because of them, I embarked
on a permaculture project to integrate earth care more fully with people care and to
try and resolve some of the other challenges I had encountered in my early attempts
at practicing permaculture. In an initial partnership with another Tagari participant,
Gary Cowan, we located a suitable property. The sustainable forestry enterprise
started at Tagari Farm became a successful little tree planting and reforestation
contracting company. In short order I re-formed it into Permaforest Trading Trust
which funded its slightly younger twin, a charitable sustainability education
organization called Permaforest Trust. This dual trust structure, a trading trust and a
charitable trust, is straight out of Chapter 14 of the Designers Manual. Bill Mollison
gave me a copy of the Permaculture Institute’s trust deed to use as the basis for
Permaforest Trust’s deed. I am the Trustee of both trusts and manage them by their
deeds, which mandate trading and sustainability education respectively. My tree
planting contracting business grew and funded the Permaforest Trust. It became the
owner of the 170 acres of undeveloped farm land and forest we had located. The
land was at Barkers Vale in NSW, half an hour west of Wollumbin (Mt Warning), on
the lush and rugged sub tropical volcanic back slopes of the old shield volcano’s
caldera.

In 1998 Permaforest Trust began to use the funds gifted to it by Permaforest Trading
Trust to establish a permaculture education centre and demonstration farm on the
land. This centre was referred to as Permaforest Trust. The idea was to create an
educational community- a residential centre where people could live together
temporarily and learn permaculture through modelling sustainable rural living. At first
the number of participants was quite small but as we built the accommodation and

common areas and planted gardens and trees, the numbers grew. Eventually we
built up to an average population of about 20 students, managers and visitors living
and working at the centre. After much hard work and persistence, based in large part
on an integral perspective, we managed to create a stable and functional centre
where we demonstrated a reasonable attempt at permaculture community living. Our
resource use was much lower than most Australians, our permaculture practices
were moderately productive and were having a beneficial effect on the land. In the
end, I think, it was actually much better than that, and we did manage to achieve
something quite special and unique in the way we practiced permaculture,
particularly with regard to people care and the community dimension.

There were two reasons why we ended the experiment at this point. Firstly, after a
period it was very difficult to improve sustainability indicators. We were remaining
dependent on the goods and services of a consumptive and energy-rich economy.
Secondly, the energy and resources required to facilitate the human dimensions of
the project made it unsustainable for those of us managing it. My experience is that
this is something of a pattern and as such I couldn’t see that it was a
recommendable strategy to scale up. In its own way it was another unsustainable
attempt at modelling sustainability. This is not necessarily a bad thing if recognized,
and it may be that this paradox holds an important clue for developing more effective
perspectives on sustainability into the future. That is, it may be more effective to look
at sustainability as a process rather than a destination: an ever-receding goal at the
edge of endeavour.

The period of experimentation with the educational community at Permaforest Farm
lasted roughly a decade - from 1997 to 2007. Initially it was my home and that of a
few other committed participants, but as the numbers grew and the centre took
shape, so did the challenges. Earth care, in all its various manifestations - gardening,
other elements of permaculture design, organic agriculture, sustainable forestry and
bush regeneration primarily, while not without problems, was not our main challenge.
The recurring limitations to learning and living permaculture were the people. While I
tried to put a special emphasis on people care strategies based on my experience at
Tagari farm, I still managed to seriously underestimate the magnitude of this
challenge. It wasn’t until I developed a more integral approach using strategies for
the ‘inner landscapes’ of self and culture to the same degree that my permaculture
training had taught me to focus on strategies and techniques for the ‘outer
landscape’ of nature, that we really started to make progress.

An Integral Approach

If I had not come across the integral framework created by Ken Wilber, it is unlikely
that the Permaforest project would have reached such a satisfying conclusion.
Wilber’s work helped me understand a whole range of challenges in my
permaculture work from a new perspective and to solve them in novel and effective
ways. Before we can move on to the practical examples of how an integral
orientation helped us meet the challenges at Permaforest Trust, we’ll have to spend
some time on a thumbnail sketch of some relevant aspects of Integral Theory. I
realize that a brief treatment of some seemingly academic aspects of integral theory
may initially seem overly technical and unnecessarily abstract, but I would ask the
reader to persevere. Alternatively, you may skip to the summary at the end of this
section, or read it knowing that initially a comprehensive understanding is not
necessary. I’m including it here because I think some readers will want a basic
understanding in assessing its usefulness. While the theory may appear quite
abstract initially, it becomes much more concrete as it is unpacked and related to
practical situations. I’m outlining the framework here as a very effective practical tool.
The interested reader may wish to consult some of Wilber’s works cited in the
reference section.

David Holmgren, co-founder of the permaculture concept, mentions in his writings
that permaculture is part of the postmodern cultural emergence. With its foundation
in the new, more holistic systems sciences, including ecology and systems ecology,
its counter culture adherents, radical self-reliance, questioning of industrial
institutions and processes - especially green revolution agriculture- as well as its
sensitive ethics, permaculture can be counted as one of the most influential grass
roots initiatives of this period. The modern industrial era started to emerge some
400 years before the postmodern, the traditional agricultural period had its
beginnings up to 10 000 years before that, while the original period of human history

had its beginnings some hundreds of thousands of years before that, indicating that
the pace of cultural development is speeding up over time.

Only 40 years into the postmodern period, it is thought by some that the post-post-
modern, or ‘integral’ era is now emerging. Among many other things, postmodern
culture can be credited with sensitising us to the diversity of natural elements, their
interconnectedness and our own dependence on these life systems, but like the
material gains of the economic industrialism of the modern period before it, this
ecological and social sensitivity is limited in its capacity for sustaining the human
project. At this time in history, personal, cultural, ecological and social dynamics are
accelerating and new challenges requiring new ways of looking at the world are
already upon us.

The Pattern That Connects

Integral Theory, because it is a philosophy that can include a place for everything,
and because it is comprehensive enough to entirely reject nothing, is often referred
to as ‘the pattern that connects’, giving it a strong association to permaculture
through its own relationship with pattern understanding. A postmodern view
sensitises us to the interconnected diversity of elements in the natural world, but it is
an integral orientation that is critical for identifying the patterns that shape these
parts into coherent designs, again demonstrating a resonance with permaculture as
a design discipline. Permaculture aspires to a more integral approach through the
recognition that sustainability practice must contain ethics as well as design
techniques. That is, it must work with values which reside in the inner landscapes of
human experience as well as the material outer landscapes of natural ecologies and
human economies. Despite these similarities, permaculture has not yet emerged as
a fully integral discipline. I think the aspects of Integral Theory outlined below can
contribute to a more fully integral permaculture and that this is an interesting, and in
my case, very helpful direction to head with the practice of sustainability.

Holons

Integral Theory starts with the now widely-held systemic or ‘design thinking’
understanding that everything is both a part and a whole at the same time, or a

‘holon’. Whole atoms are parts of whole molecules, which are parts of whole cells,
which are in turn parts of whole organs, which are parts of whole organisms in the
ongoing structuring of more complex forms. This view of nature as a kind of nested
hierarchy or ‘holarcy’ is now common in the ecological and systems sciences,
contributing an essential understanding to general eco-literacy.

Here, Integral Theory adds the view that just as partness and wholeness are limited
perspectives on one integrated part/whole, so too is its status as either a material
object or an aware subject. In fact, any holon is an integrated occurrence with four
main aspects or perspectives: partness (individual), wholeness (collective),
objectiveness (exterior) and subjectiveness (interior). (See Figure 1).

Different cultures hold views that reality is either inner experience or outer objects,
fundamentally material or ultimately spiritual; basically just matter or essentially
mind. The integral view is that it is both, and that combined with the view that things
are also parts and wholes these four aspects are just different perspectives on one
thing. These four aspects are often referred to as the four quadrants of a holon. Add
to the concept of the four-quadrant holon the idea that more complex forms evolve in
a dynamic fashion through the integration of less complex forms and we have the
bones of an integral view: parts and wholes; insides and outsides; developmental
evolution.

I-Space

If we look at the intersection of the interior perspective (subjective inner aspect) and
the individual perspective (part aspect) of a person we could call this the ‘self’- one’s
own subjective experience or awareness, and all of the related thoughts, emotions
and sensations that manifest there. In permaculture there is a nascent recognition of
this perspective as Zone 00.

We-Space

If we look at the interior perspective (subjective inner aspect) of the collective
perspective (whole or community aspect) we get ‘culture’- a group’s shared
interiorities like ethics and values. In permaculture this perspective is honoured by
the ethic of ‘people care’.
                                            10
Eco-Space

Where we look at the exterior perspective (objective outer aspect) of the individual
perspective (part aspect) we get a view of the characteristics and behaviours of that
individual element of nature; where we look at the exterior perspective (objective
outer aspect) of the collective perspective (whole or community aspect) we get a
natural systems perspective represented by both ecologies and economies. In
permaculture this perspective is honoured by the ethic of ‘earth care’ and the main
principles and practices of sustainable design in agriculture and the built
environment.

For the purposes of this discussion we can place both quadrants in the right hand
half under the name ‘nature’ (see Figure 1). Self, culture and nature are called the
‘Big Three’ in Integral Theory. In my permaculture work I often refer to them as ‘I-
space’, ‘we-space’ and ‘eco-space’. These are the three major domains of human
experience and therefore it is essential to include each of these perspectives in any
initiative. Just this one seemingly simple realization provided essential and powerful
strategies for some of the most serious challenges we faced at Permaforest Trust, as
we will see.

                                                  11
Body, Mind and Spirit

The evolutionary aspect of Integral Theory translates into the view that everything
develops in stages, and that each new stage both transcends (goes beyond) and
includes (is actually built from) the elements of the level before. Permaculture tells us
that careful observation of any natural process will reveal a pulsing dynamic of
identifiable stages of development, whether in the growth of a plant, the
implementation of a design or the succession of an ecological system. For instance,
we can identify the ecological succession of a forest ecology from pioneer stage, to
early secondary, late secondary and finally to the mature stage. What is important
here is that it is impossible to exclude or reject anything from the previous levels of
development without destroying the whole. The whole is made up of all previous
stages. Pioneer species are embodied in the soil fertility of the later stages. It would
be impossible to skip this stage or to remove it from the process. The trick is to
understand how pioneering processes work and when and how to use them. In
permaculture for instance, we use the principle of accelerating succession through
the pioneer stage or alternatively maintaining a system in its productive pioneering
phase. The idea is to work with pioneer dynamics and to make the pioneer stage as
functional as possible in service of the whole process. This understanding of stages
is a core eco-literacy in permaculture, but in integral work the principle is used more
widely; this evolutionary dynamic is translated from eco-space into we-space and I-
space.

If we take the evolutionary unfolding from a big picture perspective, it can look
something like this: where conditions in the realm of matter (the physiosphere) are
favourable, life can arise; where conditions are favourable in the realm of life (the
biosphere) mind can arise; where conditions are favourable in the domain of mind
(the noosphere) then spirit can arise (the theosphere). In short, the process of
evolution goes from matter to body to mind to spirit. If this is true, then we have a
way to integrate the material worldview of the modern west with the more spiritual
world views held historically in the east. Mind and matter are not opposites, but two
aspects of one evolutionary continuum.

                                           12
If we step away from the big picture and look at an individual human being, we can
look at the evidence that people go through a process of growth and development.
Stages of personal development have been identified by a number of researchers
including Abraham Maslow, Robert Kegan, Jean Piaget, Susan Cook-Greuter and
Jane Loevinger to name just a few. They may be looking at different aspects of
development and have different names for their stages, but the one commonality is
that they have all identified a process of growth much like the general one outlined
above, where each new stage transcends but also includes the previous stages. The
simplest set of personal development stages is from body (emotion centred
awareness) to mind (mental/rational centred awareness) to spirit (more
compassionate transpersonal awareness). Understanding this progress in human
development helps us understand the importance of integrating the wisdom of the
body with the intellect of the mind in order to gain a wider, transpersonal level of
awareness that can support a more integrated, dynamic view of reality.

Altitude

Similarly, theorists such as Jean Gebser, Clare Graves and Don Beck have identified
stages of development in culture. At this point I’m going to simplify and generalize
this work for the permaculture context based on my own experience. For practical
purposes we will discuss four cultural stages. I’ll name them using the colour scheme
from the Integral framework referred to as stages or levels of ‘altitude’. Altitude is a
general marker of development that may be used for correlative levels in culture
(collective) and the self (individual). See Figure 2 for a diagram of correlates in each
quadrant. Each cultural level or altitude is characterized by a core set of values and
by an increasing capacity for inclusion. Values are simply what the people at this
stage of development collectively hold to be most important; inclusion is the capacity
to include others in one’s sphere of care. Each level of altitude also leads to a
definitive worldview that shapes how its members see the world. Most people can
intuitively sense levels of cultural development if they are presented using some
commonly recognizable traits, which is how I’ll introduce them here. Altitude, as
                                            13
mentioned above, also functions as short hand for levels of individual development. I
will attempt to introduce cultural and personal levels of altitude concurrently below.

Amber

Amber cultural groups value belonging through order. They are often absolutist and
patriarchal, with strong hierarchical social structures. Individuals expressing amber
altitude will have strong community and family values and mythic religious beliefs.
This value set is often expressed politically through groups promoting family values
and traditional morals. Older children who have mastered and enforce household or
community structures are expressing an amber orientation. Amber cultures
transcend earlier cultures and can be seen as an evolutionary step that allowed for
their aggregation in the development of complex civilizations in the agricultural
period. The sphere of care is wider than anything that came before, but still limited to
a nation, club, team or other identifiable group thought of as ‘my people’. I’ll use the
term ‘traditional’ when referring to communities and individuals oriented around this
level or stage. The members of this level of altitude amount to about 25 percent of
the Western world. Amber worldview started to emerged about 10 000 years ago.

Orange

At the Orange level of altitude people value individual rights, achievement and
performance. Economic material gain is often identified as the way to generate the
greatest good. Rational, scientific understandings of the world are most highly
regarded. Orange typically emerges for the individual around late high school or
early adulthood. Orange cultures transcend Amber cultures in that their wider ethics
of productive economy create a market that can include more people within their
system of organization. Orange is seen as the worldview of the enlightenment and
subsequent period of rapid industrialization in the West. I use the term ‘modern’
when referring to this level of altitude. The members of this level of altitude amount
to approximately 40 percent of the Western world. Orange perspectives started to
emerge en mass about 400 years ago.

Green

                                           14
Green values sensitivity and diversity. It can include multiple perspectives on reality.
People in Green are often sensitive to social injustice, animal rights and ecological
destruction. Their sensitivity makes them good communicators and their values are
often expressed in postmodern academic concepts such as the deconstruction of
power, relativism and contextual approaches to knowledge and understanding.
Green’s sphere of care is wider than Orange in that it can care for all people
regardless of whether they are customers or trading partners. It is fully world-centric
in orientation and will manifest as lifestyle choices like vegetarianism as a response
to the imperative to care for animals. Green sensitivities inform postmodern
perspectives from environmentalism and deep ecology, fair trade and anti-
globalization activism, to collaborative online communities and the design of
advanced communications architectures like the world wide web. Green altitude
fosters the worldview that I have refered to as ‘postmodern’. The members of this
level of altitude currently represent about 20-25 percent of the population of the
Western world. Green, postmodern perspectives emerged as a general world view
only some 40 years ago

Teal

While all the altitudes so far represent a developmental advance (and of course
inclusion) on the level before them, at the Integral level of altitude there is a major
change in the nature of development. The altitudes from original to postmodern are
all exclusive worldviews. That is, if you ask, say, a modern executive of an export
wood chipping company at Orange attitude if they think that a post modern Green
initiative to save the forest is responsible, they will say no it is not. Alternatively
Green activists will not condone wood chipping as responsible. A traditional farmer
or original inhabitant will have their own different interpretation of the common good
in this instance. In fact none of the first tier altitudes related here will accept the
values of the others as fundamentally legitimate.

At the integralTeal level of altitude the entire holarchy of nested development - from
original to traditional (which transcends but includes original) to modern (which
transcends but includes the previous two) to postmodern (which transcends but
includes the previous three) - is seen as an integrated whole. From an integral

                                             15
perspective, you can’t remove modern values of productivity and exchange from
society any more than you could remove your lungs or your kidneys from your body.
At an integral altitude, all worldviews are accepted as valid. The way forward is not to
pick one at the exclusion of the others, but to integrate and balance the different
ways of seeing the world for the best overall outcome. The way to work with this
practically is to encourage healthy and appropriate expressions of each world view
where they are found. Like a Green postmodern approach, a Teal integral
perspective accepts diversity, but it goes farther and recognizes patterns and order
in diversity necessary for unitive health. By virtue of its pattern oriented, more
comprehensive view, an integral perspective can generate an inclusive,
compassionate capacity for all previous altitudes, marking it as a second tier altitude.
Because of their more exclusive nature, the first three altitudes- Amber, Orange and
Green- are referred to as first tier altitudes. Members of a second tier, integral
altitude represent roughly 2-3 percent of the Western world, with some evidence of a
more substantial demographic trend in this direction. An integral world view is only
now emerging as a widespread set of perspectives in the Western world.

In summary we now have the three domains of Self/I-space, Culture/we-space and
Nature/eco-space (based on the quadrants) as well as four levels: Amber/traditional,
Orange/modern, Green/postmodern and Teal/integral (based on altitudes) to work
with as we explore an integral permaculture. Technically the foundation Integral
framework developed by Ken Wilber contains five elements: quadrants and levels,
which we have covered here, and states, lines and types, which we do not have time
for in this short chapter. The interested reader should see A Theory of Everything by
Ken Wilber for a more comprehensive introduction.

An Integral Permaculture

Now that we have a background in some of the basic elements of integral theory we
can take a brief tour through some of the ways that it assisted our permaculture
practice at Permaforest Trust. It is fair to say that as the project grew in scope and in
numbers so did the challenges. For a while they seemed insurmountable and there
was a great deal of confusion as to why our permaculture ideals and practices were
leading to such dysfunctional outcomes. One by one though, we put in place
strategies based on a more integral perspective that lead to real results and tangible
improvements.

We-Space Strategies

One of our first realizations was that we really only considered it permaculture if it
was earth care. Our attention was almost exclusively focused on creating outcomes
                                               17
in eco-space. Care of people, we-space, was almost always seen as something
secondary. I don’t think we were unique in this. It is not at all common in my
experience to find permaculture projects that explicitly put people first. Although
people care is the stated second ethic of permaculture, and even though we were
initially conscious of the importance of the community dimension to our project,
initially anyway, it always came second. It was only after realizing that it needed to
be at least equal to eco-space practices that we started to see improvements. After
this realization we developed a detailed community handbook that spelled out our
values and expectations. We sent it to people before they came and asked them to
voluntarily commit to the system. We put in place management and support team
systems to encourage adherence to the community system and we scaled back on
eco-space activity to support more we-space activity.

I-Space Strategies

A natural follow on from re-prioritizing we-space, was the realization that individuals
needed significant support as well. Initially most of us managing and participating in
the project were firmly rooted in a sensitive, post modern/green worldview. This has
common challenges like ‘endless meetings’ where consensual decision making
included much discussion and dialogue about feelings and interpersonal dynamics.
But it also had more serious dimensions. The realities of restrictions on personal
freedom inherent in community living often caused ongoing psychological and
emotional trauma, even among the most well-meaning and passionate of
participants.

Personal freedom is a hidden form of wealth or resource use in postmodern culture.
Only very wealthy industrially based societies like our own can support so many
people with so much autonomy. When it is taken away or, in our case, voluntarily
given up, even by people with strong ideals of low resource, community living, it can
cause significant resentment, rebellion, anger and depression. Putting in place
strategies to support the healthy transition to a more ecologically sustainable lifestyle
was the most taxing of all the dynamics we had to deal with. We did manage to
develop strategies for managing and supporting these personal transitions, but in the
end, given our isolated rural setting and minimal resources, we could not sustain this

                                           18
effort. Management was constantly in danger of burning out through using their own
energy and personal resources to support the participants’ I-space challenges. It is
essentially why we ended our experiment of modelling a rural permaculture
educational community. To this day, I see I-space challenges as one of the most
significant aspect of transitioning to a sustainable future.

At this juncture it may look like an integral perspective was not enough, but I look at
it somewhat differently. Firstly, while an integral approach has proved very effective,
it is not a cure all. And, secondly, if we didn’t develop an awareness of the
importance of I-space, we might have burned out before we could successfully
conclude that phase of the work of Permaforest Trust and move on to more viable
undertakings. An integral perspective was critical in avoiding collapse by allowing us
to see our limits in the I-space dimension. In a more general sense this may be a
very important integral perspective on the dynamics of global sustainability transition.
Trauma and healing modalities as well as personal growth and development
practices may become some of our most powerful strategies in sustainability.

The Tyranny of Structurelessness- Using Healthy Amber

Another aspect of the project’s participants being generally oriented in a
Green/postmodern worldview was an overt regard for non-hierarchical social
structures. This extended to a disregard and a general dislike and distrust of
structured social arrangements in general. This is an understandable reaction to the
oppressive dominator hierarchies at work in modern society. They are rightly seen as
unhealthy and unsustainable in their pathological form, but removing all structure as
a reaction can lead to equally poor outcomes that become a tyranny in themselves -
a tyranny of structurelessness. I’ve already related the dysfunction caused by a lack
of structure at Tagari Farm. Similarly, for us this structurelessness lead to a
confusing morass of unfinished tasks, unmet commitments, interpersonal
dysfunction and personal dissatisfaction. A postmodern view allowed us to
deconstruct unhealthy power structures, which is fine, but it didn’t help us focus on
how to put the parts back together in a functional way. At times it felt like we were
compulsive deconstructors adrift in a decaying marsh of our own undifferentiated

                                            19
deconstructions. The solution provided by an integral perspective was to get in touch
with healthy Amber values of clear structure and organization in social relationships.

Having a community system and a handbook to support it, mentioned above, was
helpful, but what really made it work was explaining it and practicing it in an
acceptable way. We carefully and intentionally related that it was essential for the
health of the community that people meet their community commitments, and that it
was essentially unethical in a fair and equitable community system to let others
down. Ultimately, and this was the hardest part, we had to enforce this structure. We
had a procedure of positive support and motivation for people who struggled, but
there was a limit after which people were asked to leave if they could not meet their
commitments. There was no negativity attached to this, only a recognition that the
situation need to be resolved for the wider good. This may have been our most
successful integral intervention: things became substantially better after we
established and enforced this community structure - it was like night and day. The
level of functionality and the general well being it facilitated was, in my view, the
reason visitors often commented that they felt there was something special going on
at Permaforest Trust.

Poverty Consciousness- Using Healthy Orange

Another important dynamic having a negative effect on the project was a general
‘poverty consciousness’. What I mean by this is that there was a general disdain for
anything to do with money and commerce- poverty was seen as a kind of
sustainability virtue. Often people wore a kind of faux Western poverty as a badge of
honour. This seems to be endemic in the environmental line of development in
postmodern circles, which I refer to as ‘Deep Green’. I use this term in much the
same way it is used in Deep Ecology: to denote a more meaningful depth of
engagement in the topic. Other lines of postmodern development like internet
technology, environmental policy making and the emerging green public relations
field, seem to have less aversion to money, and it can be seen in others like social
activism, fair trade, green politics and aid and development circles. In my view, this is
another reaction to over-consumptive industrial economic processes that are seen to
be so environmentally destructive. Again, it is understandable, but there is actually

                                            20
nothing healthy about writing off productive economic patterns and commerce. We
didn’t focus on the business of environmental education as much as we should have
in the beginning and it caused a lot of stress. There was, I have to say, an
entitlement mentality when it came to education. This extended to us even though
we were an independently funded, self-reliant, pioneering educational facility with
few resources relative to government or corporate education programs. We were
trying to model self-reliance and did not have any direct government support.

The answer to our economic stress was to get in touch with healthy Orange values
of productive exchange and economy. We put together a business plan, budgeted
effectively, marketed our product, made our fees clear, collected them and
developed good value in our educational offering. We actually had good business
skills, but we needed an integral framework to put us in touch with the importance of
integrating them fully into the project. We also extended this ethic of productivity to
our permaculture work and it helped us to hit new highs in organic food production
and sales. As with introducing Amber inspired social structures, putting in place
Orange structures around commercial processes and productivity systems led to
some very subtle but definite peer pressure to diminish these activities. They just
looked too ‘conventional’ and therefore unsustainable to anyone viewing from a first-
tier perspective. Over time we learned to stand firmly at an integral level, and as we
did, more and more participants started to see the benefits and to investigate an
integral perspective for themselves.

The Heart Circle - Using Healthy Green

At this stage we were well aware that although we had manifestations of some
unhealthy Green patterns, we did not want to give away Green perspectives
altogether. After one gains some perspective on Green values and patterns there
can be a bit of a tendency to develop an allergy to them and to the Green level of
altitude in general. This is typical of first tier development. When one develops to the
next perspective it is inhabited exclusively, with little room for previous values or
views. It is a bit like the pattern of reformed smokers who becomes extremely critical
of their friends who continue to smoke.

                                            21
We became conscious of nurturing our Green strengths, diminishing the pathologies
and integrating with values and practices native to other altitudes. Practicing
sustainability became a bit like practicing Traditional Chinese Medicine - we worked
to balance and integrate all of the energies and dynamics of our system for enduring
health.

One of the most important Green processes we developed was the Heart Circle.
This is a process modified from Rainbow Gatherings. All participants sit in a circle
and take turns speaking. One person talks at a time only and everyone listens until
they are done. It is a sacred, intentional space where people can speak their truth
and speak from the heart. Commentary can be extremely personal and deeply
critical. It is a very powerful and intense interpersonal space, full of emotional depth,
deep honesty, sensitivity, great joy and equally great sorrow, anger and sometimes
immense ecstasy. By developing this space and intentionally containing this energy
we could honour the depth and beauty of being Green in a healthy way that allowed
us to integrate it into our lives without this powerful energy dominating all of our other
process.

Conclusion

I would like to emphasize here that the integral framework is a map only, and a
simple one at that. Reality, the territory it tries to describe, is infinitely complex,
ultimately mysterious and if we are honest only partially knowable. A good map,
though, can be very helpful in navigating a real terrain.

Using even the few insights from a basic integral perspective related here was
enormously helpful in our work during the ten years Permaforest Trust experimented
as a rural permaculture educational community. The Integral framework continues to
inform my understanding and work within permaculture, Permaforest Trust and
sustainability more generally. There was a time when the pathologies, dogmas and
difficulties of ‘making permaculture work’ in a Green milieu almost caused me to give
it away altogether. Now, I can see the strengths of permaculture more clearly and I
am more effective at working through its weaknesses.

                                              22
An integral perspective allows me to see my world in a similar way. I am comfortable
with it again. Not through ignorance, but through understanding. It doesn’t have to be
rejected, I don’t have to live outside of it to have an ethical existence, it doesn’t have
to fought, it is not going to fall in a screaming heap and I don’t have to fix it. It is
beautiful because it is what it is and it cannot be anything other. Its current dynamics
are obviously unsustainable, but I now have a faith in the patterns of systemic
adaptation, organization and change. There is a source of order and evolution at
work in our world and there is great power in working with this process. This is not a
naive or passive faith. It is, indeed, a clear awareness, a critical call to action, but it is
not by fighting the various parts of our greater Self that we will persevere. Our
greatest hope lies with the compassion to harmonize the great depth and span of
reality using the principles and patterns of Natural organization.

An integral permaculture must use its strength for identifying natural patterns and
principles in the ‘environment’ and apply them to the ‘environments’ of self and
culture as well as nature. We must use our insights more comprehensively by
recognizing and integrating the many worldviews held by the planet’s many peoples.
And, we must have the compassion to embrace all of our world, while having the
wisdom to eliminate its pathologies wherever we find them. While an integral
permaculture may not be about spirit, it does make room for genuine spiritual
practice, allowing the integration of this very important and powerful aspect of human
and cultural development. Becoming skilful in combining these elements is a great
step forward in facilitating the enduring health of our civilization.

Few disciplines have permaculture’s practical foundation in learning and using
natural patterns and principles. Fewer still have integrated foundations in ethics,
people care and earth care. Also, permaculture has a unique capacity for facilitating
local community self reliance in food, energy and other critical commodities during
sustained periods of resource decline. If our perspective about approaching bio-
physical limits to growth and impending energy descent is correct, then a more fully
integral permaculture- one that can combine the strengths of the various sectors of
our communities, support individuals in personal transition and offer viable
alternatives in agriculture and local economy- will become critically important. In a
future of declining outer material growth there is an opportunity and a likelihood of an
                                              23
increasing alternative trend in towards inner, personal and spiritual growth. An
integral permaculture can become a vehicle where providing us with what we need
becomes a way of realizing the potential for who we can more fully become.

        ABSTRACT This article introduces an experimental typology and its application to the horizontal
        development of Integral Sustainability. The typology, PatternDynamics™, is derived from observa-
        tions and experiences of natural and social systems and the study of scientific, ecological, and eco-
        nomic systems disciplines. It is composed of a set of graphic symbols representing natural organiz-
        ing principles, or recurrent dynamic patterns of relationships, important for sustaining ecological
        and economic health in the Lower-Right quadrant. Developing a sustainability pattern language
        creates three strategic opportunities: 1) it extends a now commonplace set of objective systemic
        insights (Lower Right) to facilitate a less common but essential set of mutual understandings in the
        Lower-Left quadrant; 2) a graphically-based pattern language provides the opportunity to commu-
        nicate sustainability perspectives as neutral visual symbols containing diﬀerent levels of meaning
        for diﬀerent levels of altitude, giving an integral initiative a novel means of enfolding, accepting, and
        enacting intra-level meaning; and 3) it facilitates sustainability leadership by providing a strategy
        for communicating and coordinating sustainability from an integral perspective. Climate change is
        discussed using Integral Theory and PatternDynamics™ as an example of how any topic within the
        greater context of sustainability may be approached more comprehensively using tailored AQAL
        methodologies and tools.

            The central claim made by the evolutionary systems sciences is that, whatever the
            actual nature of these three great domains, they are all united, not necessarily by
            similar content, but because they all express the same general laws or dynamic pat-

P    erhaps the defining feature of our times is an underlying “anxiety of collapse” created by a clear-eyed
     view of unsustainable behavior, on the one hand, and on the other, the helplessness we experience as
initiatives for change are swept aside by the forces of seemingly intractable global complexity (Diamond,
2005; Homer-Dixon, 2006; Tainter, 1988). This anxiety is not generated from a lack of understanding—a

powerful minority understands the ecological realities and the challenges ahead all too well (Brown, 2006;
Meadows et al., 2004)—and it is not from a lack of solutions. In fact, it is entirely possible that we understand
our ecological situation well enough, as we have successfully tested enough environmental, technological,
social, and economic initiatives to succeed (Holmgren, 2002; Odum & Odum, 2001). The problem is that
these solutions are, for the most part, small in scale, uncoordinated, and unintegrated. After 40 years of en-
vironmentalism, policy traction is currently too small in light of the size of the problem (Shellenberger &
Nordhaus, 2004). We shout for global action and relatively few people listen—even fewer act. The lack of
change creates frustration, making it appear that our only option is to fight for our perspective (mostly by
fighting other perspectives).

Our anxiety, then, is born of a fundamental failure to communicate, and it is reaching a fever pitch. In des-
peration we may resort to extreme positions, manipulation, or force to get large-scale action on sustainability,
but this will ultimately be an unsustainable approach in itself, accelerating breakdown rather than coordinat-
ing action. Therefore, facilitating effective communication and widespread mutual understanding is now a
critical strategy in sustainability.

What is missing is not more “exterior” technologies or more evidence about the nature of the exterior world,
but a critical mass of “interior” agreement about how to proceed based on what we already know. One of
the keystones to sustainability at this stage is the development of its cultural meaning. This is the essential
prerequisite to widespread action, as sustainability is now as much a cultural phenomenon as an ecological
one—it requires mass collaboration on a global scale. This in turn will require an evolution in communica-
tion, understanding, leadership, culture, and action. Will a unity of mind and technique allow us to facilitate
enduring health and evolution? Or will we flounder, applying partial and fragmented approaches to complex
challenges?

The Integral Approach
In this article I will review the Integral framework briefly, examine sustainability generally, and climate
change specifically. Then I move on to explore some important features of integral typologies and to review
the origin of contemporary pattern languages. Lastly, PatternDynamics™ is introduced and used to discuss
climate change in order to build cultural meaning from an integral perspective.

Quadrants
The AQAL model, as developed by Ken Wilber and colleagues, provides us with a realistic foundation for
integrated and coordinated planetary action in sustainability. The five elements of the framework (quadrants,
levels, lines, states, and types) represent a comprehensive and therefore, at this stage, eminently useful
means of developing strategies in sustainability. Quadrants are the foundation to an Integral approach. They
represent “primordial perspectives” through which we experience the world. Figure 1 illustrates how the
perspectives are generated using a simple matrix. The matrix integrates the primacy of interior (subjective)
and exterior (objective) realities as well as individual and collective realities. Where the individual and the
interior intersect is the “intentional,” subjective experience of the self, found in the Upper-Left (UL) quad-
rant. The individual and the exterior give us a “behavioral” perspective, with the material characteristics and
activities of individual organisms in the Upper-Right (UR) quadrant. The interior of the collective represents

the cultural domain: shared perspectives of meaning, values, and beliefs are attributed to the Lower-Left (LL)
quadrant. Exterior and collective domains intersect to form the social or systems perspective of ecologies and
economies within the Lower-Right (LR) quadrant (Fig. 1).

In Integral Theory, the universe is often described as being fundamentally composed of holons (Koestler,
1969). A holon is defined as something that is simultaneously a whole in its own right and a part of larger
systems. In addition to its simultaneous partness and wholeness, a holon also has both subjective and objec-
tive aspects. From atoms, to molecules, to cells, to organs, to organisms—everything in the universe (or more
properly in integral terminology, the Kosmos) can be viewed through the four quadrants. In the domain of
Integral Sustainability, the Integral framework includes standard ecological systems perspectives (LR), while
not excluding or marginalizing less common behavioral perspectives (UR), cultural/intersubjective perspec-
tives (LL), or experiential/subjective perspectives (UL).

The four-quadrant approach actively explores many critical perspectives not currently considered with the
same weighting as LR ecological and economic concerns (Wilber, 1995). The Integral framework is, of
course, ultimately only partial itself in relation to further developments in human understanding, but it ap-
pears to be a leading (and quite likely the leading) theoretical and practical approach inclusive enough to
provide integrated solutions capable of avoiding the failures of current, more partial, and less coordinated
attempts to foster sustainability (Esbjörn-Hargens & Zimmerman, 2009).

Levels
Levels provide insight into the developmental, evolutionary aspects of sustainability. Developmental unfold-
ing takes place in identifiable levels (also referred to as stages or waves) in each quadrant. For instance, we

could look at the big picture of evolutionary systems on planet earth (LR) from physical matter (physio-
sphere) to living ecologies (biosphere) to financial economies (noosphere). The general progression is from
less complexity to more complexity. Or, we could look at a representation of levels at a smaller, human time
scale called altitude. Altitude is a general marker indicating similar levels of development that can span both
the interior consciousness of individuals (UL) and the interior of groups of people or cultures (LL) as well
as correlative development in the other quadrants (Wilber, 2006). Altitude is expressed using a color scheme
related to the spectrum displayed in a rainbow. Eight or more levels of consciousness are commonly used
(Fig. 2), but for our purposes we need to discuss only five of the most relevant to sustainability. Three of these
levels are first tier, indicating that individuals or groups associated with these levels identify exclusively with
their level of altitude. From any first-tier perspective, people at other altitudes with different values are seen
as misguided or simply wrong. A defining characteristic of second-tier altitudes is that there is a willingness
to include, balance, and integrate truths from other levels. The five levels discussed in this article are:

             First Tier
- Amber altitude refers to the conformist self, sometimes called the mythic self.
                 People at this level are rule-oriented and driven by conformist values; they rely
                 on sacred scripture to provide unifying truths, purpose, and codes of conduct.
                 Culturally, they are ethnocentric and traditional in nature, espousing family val-
                 ues based on religious edicts. They have a strong sense of community through
                 moral purpose, and they revere structured social hierarchies.
- Orange altitude indicates the conscientious or achievement-oriented self. Indi-
                 viduals at this altitude are objective thinkers, valuing autonomy, material wealth,
                 and achievement. Culturally, they are worldcentric modernists, valuing liberty,
                 universal rights, and humanist thinking based on ideals of the Enlightenment.
- Green altitude represents the sensitive self. People at this level express indi-
                 viduality and value sharing, communication, and the recognition of culturally-
                 constructed contexts. Culturally, they are postmodern, worldcentric, and egali-
                 tarian, valuing multiculturalism, web-of-life systems views, environmentalism,
                 and social justice.

             Second Tier
- Teal altitude represents the holistic self. At this level, people are autonomous
                and through that capacity are conversant with a multidimensional reality of shift-
                ing contexts, chaos, and spontaneous systemic adaptations. As the first stage of
                second-tier consciousness, teal altitude accepts the value of all previous levels
                of human development. Culturally, they are holistic, valuing exceptional leader-
                ship, body-mind integration, and life service in the resolution of complex sys-
                temic social and cultural dynamics.
- Turquoise marks the integral self. Individuals at this level demonstrate compas-
                sion, open-heartedness, and wisdom in their commitment to action. Joy and suf-
                fering are held equally as radiant expressions of a Kosmos infused with divinity,
                energy, and beauty. Culturally, they are Kosmoscentric, valuing the care of all
                beings. They have a deep acceptance of the world in all its manifestations and
                they revere the generation of health and evolution at all levels, in all domains.

Lines represent different aspects of development in any quadrant. For example, if we are talking about the
interior of a person (UL), then a line of development could be their musical line, their cognitive line, or their
emotional line (sometimes referred to as intelligences). States are temporary movements from a more stable
stage of development in any line to a temporary peak or regression. A person learning music may have a state
experience of virtuosity during intensive practice, but it will not last, and they will settle back to their more
stable stage of development after the moment passes.

With the first four elements of the AQAL framework we can experience phenomena within the widest pos-
sible set of perspectives, and we can investigate them with a similarly comprehensive set of perspectives
(Wilber, 2000). PatternDynamics™, the subject of the remainder of this article, relates to types, the fifth ele-
ment of the AQAL model.

Sustainability
Before delving into the nature of pattern languages, I will explore some important dynamics at work in sus-
tainability and climate change. How accurate is our understanding of the imperatives and priorities in sustain-
ability? Why is scientific understanding not matched by global action? How have we failed to communicate?
The key to this “action conundrum” lies in an integral analysis.

## T. WINTON

Sustainability has developed as a topic of the Right-Hand quadrants: essentially it has been an ecological
understanding about the “functional fit” between the systems of the human economy (LR) and the systems of
the biosphere (also LR). To a lesser degree sustainability has also included the conservation and protection of
plants and animals as individual beings (UR). If human socioeconomic systems undermine the health of the
biosphere to the point where it can no longer sustain us, we will falter. In other words, having transcended
the biosphere through the development of the noosphere, we also need to include the biosphere. More spe-
cifically, we can design our societies and economies using the same patterns of organization and activity that
arrange the enduring ecological workings of the biosphere, and we need to do it on a global basis (Mollison,
1988). This is a great and important truth, and it is critical for our survival and prosperity, but it can only be
seen in this way from perspectives capable of a systemic view (i.e., green altitude or higher). To successfully
implement sustainability strategies on a global basis, two things need to happen: first, the people who under-
stand ecological realities—and the need to reshape socioeconomic systems to fit with them—need to generate
agreement on how this should happen. Secondly, we need to communicate this effectively to people who do
not see sustainability as a priority.

The action conundrum can only be resolved if we learn to “see” the importance of communication that will
generate global cultural meaning (LL) to the same extent that we have learned to “see” systems as the key to
enduring health in the biosphere (LR). From an integral standpoint, focusing on the LR quadrant in sustain-
ability leaves out most of one-half of reality and a substantial part of the other. The Left-Hand quadrants are
very much underdeveloped in sustainability (Esbjörn-Hargens & Zimmerman, 2009), and the UR is often
ignored as the province of an outdated positivistic scientific materialism.

This “quadrant absolutism” represents a serious glitch in an AQAL matrix. It holds up essential progress in
sustainability and it increases underlying anxiety. To gain the necessary global political policy traction and
worldwide community acceptance, we need to address perspectives at all quadrants and all levels as well
as find strategic leverage points using lines, states, and types. Given the slow progress using current more
limited perspectives, it is difficult to see how anything short of an Integral approach will be comprehensive
enough to resolve the complex global challenges in sustainability.

PatternDynamics™ is designed to leverage an Integral approach by creating a system of simple symbols
based on enduring patterns displayed in the biosphere (see Appendix I). We can have conversations and build
meaning (LL) about sustainability in a more comprehensive and inclusive fashion using these patterns. Also,
we can demonstrate clearly the ecological foundations of our understandings, and we can scan other perspec-
tives in sustainability for the same. The intention is to create a rich field of dialogue, understanding, agree-
ment, belief, and ultimately values that facilitate a culture of Integral sustainability. Before moving on to the
patterns themselves, I will look more closely at climate change as a perspective in sustainability.

Climate Change
The weakness in communicating the meaning of sustainability, and the historical lack of acceptance by the
global community to make it a priority, gives us some insight into the rise of climate change as the major
environmental issue of our time. Its emergence is based on the view that the Earth’s climate is currently be-
coming hotter and changing for the worse because of carbon dioxide emissions by human industry (i.e., the

6      Journal of Integral Theory and Practice—Vol. 5, No. 1

## SUSTAINABILITY PATTERN LANGUAGE

anthropogenic global warming [AGW] hypothesis) (IPCC, 2007). The AGW view, however, only gained sub-
stantial traction when it was widely promoted that AGW could cause catastrophic and irreversible warming,
making human life vastly more difficult or impossible (Hansen et al., 2007). It is not my purpose to debate the
veracity of the evidence supporting this more extreme view per se, only to evaluate it in proportion to the re-
action it has garnered. Evidence to support the extreme AGW view is not as strong as it is often portrayed, and
major supporting arguments have more recently been critiqued and considerably weakened (Plimer, 2009).

This is not to say there will not be substantial evidence to support the extreme AGW view in the future, or that
some level of AGW is not in fact occurring. However, in light of our integral analysis, we need to investigate
the nature of this popular but partial perspective and to understand why it has become the leading environ-
mental priority given the long list of worthy alternatives (see Zimmerman, 2009, pp. 13-14). For example,
perceived limitations on the continued growth in supply from the environment (e.g., hydrocarbon energy
supplies, water, essential minerals like phosphorus) and their combined effects on agriculture, global food
supply, and industry are thought by many to have much stronger supporting evidence and much better claims
to top priority in sustainability (Heinberg, 2004). To understand sustainability more fully, we may need to
discuss the “inputs” to the economy as well as the “outputs” like carbon dioxide gas. The input/output pattern
is indeed one of the fundamental patterns exhibited by all living systems and is included in the PatternDynam-
ics™ typology (see Appendix I).

Climate of Fear
It is proposed here that climate change, at least in significant part, has gained such high priority because it is
an environmental issue that, despite failures in the past, is proving to generate widespread meaning globally.
It is also proposed that it is doing so primarily through the generation of fear. For a movement not yet well
developed in generating widespread meaning and action, anything that does will be seized upon regardless
of how it generates that meaning. Whatever the quality of the evidence supporting the extreme AGW argu-
ment, it is clear that the effect of this extreme view is largely based on tapping into the underlying anxiety
about sustainability among those who feel it (e.g., large sections of the media, the scientific community, and
government and policy makers at green altitude). There is a palpable feeling of urgency and fear associated
with climate change that has sent it to the top of the list at this altitude. This is not necessarily a bad thing
in-and-of-itself if it is warranted, but as we shall see, there is a fine balance between health and pathology in
all types of dynamics.

The “climate of fear” approach has been critiqued as an unhealthy extreme in environmentalism (e.g., Crich-
ton, 2004). A lack of supporting evidence has also been seized upon as a weakness in the case for acting on
climate change more generally by those who oppose it as a policy priority (Marshall Institute, 2007). The pro-
motion of the fear of “climate collapse” has seemed to provide a much needed powerful, albeit blunt, means
of getting large sections of the global community not at green altitude to also acknowledge the importance of
sustainability. If an intersubjective circle of meaning (LL) is an important key to collective action, then tap-
ping into the fear and anxiety among individuals (UL) is a tried and true method of generating it. Generating
fear, then, has the capacity to create powerful, intralevel meaning (LL) that changes individuals’ behavior
(UR) and by extension social systems (LR).

## T. WINTON

The problem with this approach is that although it may appear to work well in the beginning, it is not sustain-
able, and it has a habit of losing effect, requiring the generation of more and more fear and anxiety. There are
limits to holding this extreme position without correlating extremely supportive evidence. If the underlying
phenomenon is not realized, or its supporting evidence is weakened further, this strategy can cease to work
altogether. If this happens, credibility is lost, undermining other important initiatives in climate change and
sustainability. Whatever the truth of AGW, clearly it is necessary to develop more skillful methods of identi-
fying, evaluating, prioritizing, and communicating climate change issues.

Types
The above analysis of meaning-making in sustainability provides us with a relevant context for our explora-
tion of types, typologies, and pattern languages. Understanding these important elements will help us work
more effectively, particularly via the Left-Hand quadrants. In Integral Theory, types are described as “items
that can be present at virtually any stage or state” (Wilber, 2009, pp. XXX) or as “horizontal styles avail-
able to any developmental level within the quadrants” (Rentschler, 2006, p. 35). Types are also described as
“stable and resilient patterns,” and that “by becoming more aware of them and their role in whatever you are
attempting to do, you are more able to infuse sustainability into your efforts by linking to existing enduring
patterns” (Sean Esbjörn-Hargens, personal communication, December 12, 2009).

Types as items, styles, or patterns may be unique within a location such as Carl Jung’s eight psychological
types (UL); William Sheldon’s body types (ectomorph, endomorph, mesomorph) (UR); researcher Jeffrey
Sonnenfield’s types of corporate culture (academy culture, baseball team culture, club culture, fortress cul-
ture) (LL); or generically recognized types like economic systems (traditional, market, command, and mixed)
(LR). In each of these examples a type of form or process is identifiable because it recurs—a type of corporate
culture is only identifiable (and useful as a concept) because it appears more than once. For my purposes, this
stable repetition of form and activity is the first property of types to be of interest. The second is that repeated
forms have a consistency that allows us to know something about a thing’s experience, culture, or nature via
its type. Third, types are generalized or generic expressions, describing a class of form or process, not the
details within it. The fourth characteristic of types, as noted in the quotations above, is that they may appear
at any level of altitude. For example, an ectomorph body type is a recurrent, consistent, general pattern of hu-
man form that occurs at all levels of UR quadrant bodily development, telling us that someone with this body
type will be thin, rather than muscular or heavy.

Horizontal Development
The features of types outlined so far help us understand recurring patterns and thus facilitate horizontal devel-
opment. They help us “flesh out” things we observe or experience, and they can lead us on a journey of more
comprehensive enactment: we can come to know more about a thing by seeing its general type. In this way
we can understand more about our subject than just its address within the AQAL framework. For example,
Carl Jung (1921) identified four main functions of consciousness: sensation and intuition (perceiving func-
tions) and thinking and feeling (judging functions). He also identified that they can have introverted and ex-
troverted forms. By combining the functions with both their introverted and extroverted forms, eight possible
configurations, which he termed psychological types, are created. Jung proposed that these are stable and
recurrent types or patterns of personalities. This approach is useful because it helps psychologists understand

8      Journal of Integral Theory and Practice—Vol. 5, No. 1

## SUSTAINABILITY PATTERN LANGUAGE

the general character of their patient (but not the details of their personality or behavior) and to understand,
for instance, the kinds of general responses their patient is likely to have in a given situation. This is true re-
gardless of the patients level of development (i.e., they will express this general type of personality no matter
what level they are). As well as location (e.g., UL quadrant, orange altitude) a psychologist can also assign
a type (say, introverted thinking), giving a more fleshed out, more comprehensive, horizontal understanding
of a patient.

Correlates and Types
It is proposed here that types not only help us understand more about phenomena at various levels of a
particular quadrant, but that they also give us insight into their correlates in other quadrants. The feminine/
masculine typology is an example of this feature of types: it can be observed as a matter of biological gender
(female/male) (UR), seen as kinds of societies (matriarchal/patriarchal) (LR), revealed as different values
within a culture (communal/individualistic) (LL), and felt as different textures of experience (feminine/ mas-
culine) (UL). There are some characteristics shared by these examples in relation to their general pattern such
that, despite their occurrence in different quadrants, we can assign them a common essential quality. This
quadratic nature of types is the fifth property we need to understand to design an Integral Sustainability pat-
tern language.

Health and Pathology in Types
Yet another feature of types is that they can be healthy or unhealthy. Ken Wilber (2000), speaking about mas-

### culine and feminine types, outlines the importance of this feature:

             Using IOS [the Integral Operating System], you will find ways to identify both the
             healthy and unhealthy masculine and feminine dimensions operating in yourself and
             in others. But the important point about this section is simple: various typologies
             have their usefulness in helping us to understand and communicate with others. And
             with any typology, there are healthy and unhealthy versions of a type. Pointing to an
             unhealthy type is not a way to judge people but a way to understand and communi-
             cate with them more clearly and effectively. (p. 89)

Here Wilber points out two things: types in-and-of-themselves are not necessarily good or bad, healthy or
pathological, but their expression can be. Having a proclivity towards a masculine, agentic, behavioral type
may be a simple reality for an individual. If that individual expresses their masculinity by operating in a
driven, self-absorbed, overly agentic way that undermines their own health or the health of their group or the
world around them, then we could say their masculinity is “sick” or creating a pathology within the system
(self-system or ecosystem). In another instance, or expressed in a way that does serve themselves or the
group, we could say the same pattern or type of behavior is healthy. For example, perhaps a hard working,
focused, independent person is essential for completing a difficult, time-sensitive task.

It is not the general quality of masculinity as a type that is important—the importance lies in its expression.
This “health and pathology” approach allows us to communicate more effectively about our world. We no
longer need to exclude essential aspects of reality. In the above example we can resist the reactionary impulse

                                                           Journal of Integral Theory and Practice—Vol. 5, No. 1   9

## T. WINTON

to generally reject masculinity because of specific examples of its pathological expression. Rather than argu-
ing about which aspects of reality should stay and which should go, we can realize that some things show up
as types, and rather than throw them out all together, we should keep them and work out how to adjust their
type for health.

Review of Types
In summary, we have explored six properties of types that make them useful: recurrence, consistency, gener-
alness, intralevel capacity, quadratic capacity, and healthy/pathological expression. Types allow us to know
recurrent, consistent, general qualities about phenomena and how to balance them for health. Before we go
any further, it should be stated that there has not been a great deal of work done on types in Integral Research
(Esbjörn-Hargens, 2009). Therefore, any work here beyond what we currently know about types is specula-
tive and hypothetical. At this stage, the use of types in the development of an Integral Sustainability typology
like PatternDynamics™ is experimental and forms a process of action research as integral praxis.

As to the actual nature of the dynamic patterns observable in nature, we will largely have to leave this for an-
other time. Although they are not individual physical elements in-and-of-themselves (the elements can transit
through the system, but the dynamic patterns—like a candle flame or a whirlwind—remain the same), rela-
tionships between elements should not be seen as metaphysical phenomena (as in Platonic ideals). They are
enacted through the perspective of the exterior collective quadrant (LR). Although they may seem ethereal by
virtue of their organizational nature, these elements should be objective and material. In this regard, Rupert
Sheldrake has made progress in describing organizational patterns affecting the growth and development of
form with his hypothesis of formative causation and the idea of morphogenetic fields (Sheldrake, 1981).

Pattern Languages
The application of types to communication and meaning-making leads us to the concept of pattern languages.
Firstly, a language is a system of communication. It is composed of signs and symbols (verbal, physical, or
drawn) that allow people to understand one another. This is a mysterious and powerful process. How is it that
the inside of me finds a space to resonate with the inside of you? How do we know that when we communi-
cate something that it has the same “meaning” for both of us?

Integral Semiotics
According to Integral Semiotics, any symbol refers to a referent, a phenomena within a worldspace, or more
colloquially, a thing in the real world (where the real world includes not just physical things, but also inte-
rior things like thoughts or feelings or values). A symbol itself has correlates in each quadrant: “By way of
quadrivia, Integral Semiotics associates the signifier with the Upper-Right quadrant, the signified with the
Upper-Left quadrant, semantics with the Lower-Left quadrant, and syntax with the Lower-Right quadrant”
(Rentschler, 2006, pp. 25-26). Again, more colloquially, the signifier is the physical symbol—the actual ink
on the page or the vibrations in the air—and the signified is what arises in my consciousness when I receive
it; its semantics relate to the meaning it has to collectives and its syntax is the rules of the system of com-
munication or how all parts of language form a whole “language system.” An integral language should honor
all of these aspects.

## SUSTAINABILITY PATTERN LANGUAGE

Christopher Alexander
The idea of a “pattern language” was first introduced, at least in the contemporary setting, by architect Chris-
topher Alexander. He created an architectural pattern language based on the idea that people should design for
themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transfor-
mation of the architectural profession), but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful

### places of the world were not made by architects but by people:

            At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people
            always rely on certain “languages,” which, like the languages we speak, allow them
            to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a formal system
            which gives them coherence. (Alexander, 1977, pp. XXX-XXX)

Alexander rightly understood that for people to design for themselves, they need a means of communicating
about architecture that allows them to form mutual understandings—understandings about the nature of good
design and agreements on how to go about creating it. In doing this, architecture is brought forth from a com-
mand and control function by professionals toward a directed collaboration capable of working effectively
in far more complex circumstances. The strength of this approach lies in its capacity to coordinate more per-
spectives, an important capacity to which I will return.

For the basis of his new language, Alexander chose patterns where, “Each pattern describes a problem that
occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice”
(Alexander, 1977, pp. XXX-XXX). The basis of this idea, that recurrent “design solutions” or what could be
thought of as types of “architectural habits” can be drawn as graphic diagrams, or what he termed “patterns,”
and that these patterns can form a language has been explored in a range of disciplines since Alexander’s
original formulation, most notably in computer programming and education.

Neighborhood Boundary Pattern
I have included two illustrations of a neighborhood boundary pattern from Alexander’s book, A Pattern Lan-
guage (1977). The first is a picture of a group of cells and their cell walls (Fig. 3). The second is a pattern
illustrating two kinds of street layouts, one that creates an effective neighborhood boundary and one that does
not (Fig. 4). Alexander’s description of this pattern outlines how an appropriate boundary is needed to protect
and nurture a healthy neighborhood in the same way a cell wall is needed to protect the interior elements of
a healthy biological cell. It then goes on to describe how a weak boundary will undermine the identity that
defines it as a neighborhood. A good boundary will be balanced: strong, but not so strong that it shuts off a
neighborhood from its surrounding neighborhoods. There are a few things here worth investigating. First, a
neighborhood boundary is identified and drawn as a pattern diagram, making it available for communication;
second, it is described; third, it is presented as representing a generic “design solution” that comes up again
and again in architecture; and fourth, it is communicated that a balanced use of the pattern in design, in a
given context, will give the best outcome.

From an integral perspective, the combination of the above four features takes a type of architectural “design

                                                        Journal of Integral Theory and Practice—Vol. 5, No. 1   11

solution” (LR) and enacts a principle (its correlate) in the domain of culture (LL): it is now understood that,
“Appropriate boundaries are necessary for beautiful and functional neighborhoods”—a balanced neighbor-
hood boundary is now a principle of good design. This provides a simple but powerful foundation for dis-
cussing the creation of good neighborhoods. It allows for discussions that create firm intersubjective meaning
about an important aspect of architecture previously so general and abstract that even professionals may only
recognize it intuitively and communicate about it haphazardly. In Alexander’s book, some 253 patterns are
comprehensively outlined. They are widely used to communicate the tried and true design solutions that make
up good architecture, and a method for exploring their various combinations is now used in collaborative
architectural design processes all over the world. For theoretical discussions supporting Alexander’s work in
architecture, interested readers should consult his book, A Timeless Way of Building (1979).

In an earlier book, Notes on the Synthesis of Form (1964), Alexander states, “I found that the diagrams them-
selves had immense power, and that, in fact, most of the power of what I had written lay in the power of these
diagrams” (pp. XXX-XXX). In this same book he displays patterns supporting design work for a village in
India that give us insight into a method where individual patterns may be related in a hierarchical manner and
combined to form a language system (Fig. 5).

## SUSTAINABILITY PATTERN LANGUAGE

PatternDynamics™
PatternDynamics™ (PD) is a typology designed to help everyone understand and communicate about the
natural patterns of organization that lead to sustainability. The patterns are recurrent, consistent, general,
types of dynamic organization observable through a LR perspective. They can be thought of as nature’s deep
design principles or as fundamental Kosmic habits that get used again and again in the creation and mainte-
nance of natural systems. In PD, each pattern in nature is represented by a graphic symbol (also referred to
as a pattern—context should allow the reader to distinguish which definition is being used) and a one-word
description (Appendix I). Both the symbol and the word give an indication of the nature of each pattern.

PatternDynamics™ assists in the horizontal development of sustainability through what is referred to as qua-
drivia (the exploration of a topic through all four quadrants): “ecologically sustainable” patterns (LR) are
transposed into “ecologically sustainable” principles (LL). In turn, discussion of these principles leads to
sustainable sensibilities (UL) that drive sustainable behaviors (UR). Also—and I think this may prove to be
very important—the patterns themselves must be considered from the perspective of ongoing evolution. How
do the patterns develop over time? How are they enacted by different levels of altitude? Which patterns or sets
of patterns resonate most fully with different levels of altitude? Which ones do not? I think the evolutionary
aspect of the patterns holds a key to widespread communication, and I am currently investigating this area to
improve the way PD can be used in sustainability work.

Once the patterns can be generally recognized across various specific instances, we can use them to touch
base with more aspects of sustainability issues, to communicate on a new level about those same issues, and
in fact to think differently and act more effectively on those issues. As with learning any language, deepen-
ing levels of acquaintance over time give us a greater capacity to use it. Our knowledge of these patterns is
introductory, but like any good introduction, I hope to give you a feel for the language and its potentials.

Structure of PatternDynamics™
The PD patterns are arranged into a hierarchical structure with three levels. The first level is composed of
one pattern, Source, representing the oldest and deepest Kosmic organizing principle. Its symbol represents
an integral holon: a part/whole with interiors/exteriors integrating and dynamically evolving. Put simply, the
first and deepest organizing principle to evolve in the Kosmos is that the Kosmos self organizes and evolves.
To go further, we do not have to agree on how this process takes place, we only really have to agree that it
happens.

All other PD patterns describe different perspectives on Source. Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Cre-
ativity, and Dynamics are first-order aspects of Source (i.e., they represent the most fundamental sub-patterns
of Source). Like Source, the first-order patterns also represent deep structures that emerged during the early
development of the Kosmos. They are all general LR patterns of organization observable in the physiosphere
and maintained as fundamental organizing dynamics into the biosphere and the noosphere. For the purposes
of an Integral approach to sustainability, my focus will be on patterns that assist with the integration of the
noosphere with the biosphere; however, there may be wider theoretical possibilities for the application of very
general patterns like these in illuminating fundamental organizing principles that coordinate activities across
the depth and span of the AQAL matrix (e.g., in the context of an Integral approach to climate change).

## SUSTAINABILITY PATTERN LANGUAGE

The remaining 49 second-order patterns are all aspects of first-order patterns: seven second-order patterns
are derived as aspects of each first-order pattern. For example, the seven second-order aspects of Rhythm are
Repetition, Swing, Cadence, Pulse, Synchronization, Enantiodromia, and Resonance. To derive the second-
order patterns, the first-order patterns are used to create a matrix (Appendix I). Where two patterns intersect
the first-order pattern from the top represents a major aspect and the first-order pattern from the side repre-
sents a minor aspect of the second-order pattern created at that location. For example, Rhythm (top) intersects
with Polarity (side) to create Swing (Fig. 6).

History of PatternDynamics™
Now that the structure of PD has been described, we can explore how to use it as an effective language in
sustainability in general and climate change in particular. Before we do that, though, I should explain the
development of the PD system, and why I think it is important apart from the theoretical reasons given so
far. Up to this point, we have discussed, for the most part, concepts that existed before PD—ideas that other
people have discussed, endeavored to prove, and formed opinions about. We have also gone through the basic
organization of the PD system itself. These concepts form the theoretical and conceptual foundations support-
ing PD. From this point forward, though, we are venturing largely into the territory of my own experience.
PD is a language I created to formalize a way of experiencing, understanding, and communicating about the
world that I intuitively developed as an Integral Sustainability practitioner.

I created the pattern set by first locating the 49 second-order patterns. The selection of these patterns was
straightforward and somewhat arbitrary—I simply wrote down the names of all the major natural patterns
that I had learned to identify over my years of working in sustainability. When I put them into like groups, I
realized that useful names for these groups were Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity, Dynam-
ics, and Source—the first-order patterns. Source was also the word I chose for the name best representing the
common quality of all the first-order patterns. I think there are multiple ways of coming up with patterns for a
sustainability pattern language, just as there are multiple sets of sounds used as the foundation of verbal lan-
guages. The set of patterns only has to be universal and comprehensive enough to build composite diagrams
for patterns that are not included in the set. I will explore a few examples of this shortly.

I have spent the past 15 years deeply engaged in the practice of sustainability: experimenting in sustainable
living, engaging in sustainability education, and working as a sustainability contractor, ecological systems
designer, and consultant. I am constantly studying sustainability theory and observing the world around me
to confirm principles I can rely on to rationalize and communicate my approach to sustainable endeavors. It
is not possible to describe the nature of each pattern here as the required foundation for using PD as a lan-
guage. (I am currently writing an introductory handbook to help with this task.) That given, more theoretical
discussion will not be the most fruitful way for us to complete this article. To gain the fullest understanding
of how the language works in this short introduction, perhaps the best way forward is for me to use a few eas-
ily recognizable parts of it to tell you a story—a story that ties back to the anxiety we can feel around issues
in sustainability, its roots, and its resolution through the communication of more integral perspectives. This
story is, in many respects, my own journey to a more integral approach.

Communicating Through Perspectives
Limited Perspectives
Looking back across my experiences in sustainability, it is clear that much of the time I was looking at the
world from a limited perspective. This perspective served as a kind of lens. It was a lens that was fixed in one
place, pointing in one direction, and, of course, I saw mostly the same things when I looked through it. Many
of the people around me were looking through the same lens, and we told ourselves the same stories about
what we were seeing. This lens, of course, was my worldview shaped by my generally green level of altitude,
and it was focused on the ecosystems of the LR quadrant. The stories we told each other were my culture.
What I saw contained a great deal of truth: the ecosystems of the Earth were being degraded by the activities
of modern industrial economies; these industries were growing rapidly around the globe; and the limits to
biophysical growth were close and getting closer. Needless to say, this fixation generated a lot of anxiety and
fear. I believed that the planet was under threat and so was the continued existence of human civilization.

I still think this is true: true, but partial. And there is the rub. A partial truth held exclusively, it turns out, can
be a terribly ineffective truth. The parable of a blind man feeling different parts of an elephant and then argu-
ing over what an elephant was really like—from their limited perspectives—makes this all too clear.

Integral Perspectives
After a time, the limitations of the more dogmatic aspects of my worldview became apparent. For example,
I observed in my forestry work that not all logging was a bad thing. Forest ecosystems could be harvested
sustainably, even on an industrial scale, if it was done in harmony with natural processes. Participation in
intentional communities also made it clear that a focus on Earth repair was not an adequate approach to or-
ganizational development or to creating effective cultures that supported intentional communities. I began to
observe processes in nature like competition that were not seen or acknowledged because they did not fit with
the story we told each other about the beauty and cooperation of nature. After a time, exclusive identification
with the level of green altitude shifted and my worldview started to change. Integral Theory was immensely
helpful at this time, as it helped me to see that I was stuck in one perspective and that by taking other perspec-
tives I could resolve some of the incongruities and difficulties that were starting to emerge.

Simple strategies like including amber altitude capacities in structuring community and orange altitude abili-
ties in economic achievement as well as green altitude creativity and sensitivity in my sustainability projects
made a huge difference to their effectiveness and health. Recognizing that sustainability had to include per-
spectives and practices to nurture the self (UL) and culture (LL) in conjunction with Earth-care work in nature
(LR) also resolved a lot of pain and dysfunction in my life and work.

After developing some familiarity with the integral practice of shifting perspectives, I uncovered a strategy
for presenting my now somewhat unconventional views on sustainability by relating them to natural patterns.
After all, these patterns had endured for billions of years as life evolved on Earth, so using them as principles
for sustaining human society made a lot of sense. One of the most effective things about this approach was
that it provided me with a way to talk about sustainability issues in a neutral, non-violent manner. Using this
approach with regard to climate change, for instance, means that we can do away with the conflict associ-
ated with labeling each other “deniers” or “alarmists.” This sort of conflict is rooted in people with limited

perspectives denying the truth of other perspectives. What we know, though, is that each perspective contains
some truth, however small it may be, and that it is much more effective to include that truth for discussion
rather than to eliminate it altogether.

Using PatternDynamics™
I will demonstrate some of the uses of PD by continuing my discussion of climate change. The PD pattern
Boundary represents the principle that systems at all scales and in all domains have limiting edges that form
interfaces and barriers with the greater systems around them (Appendix I). They also contain the elements of
any system as a “whole.” One of the important boundaries in climate change is the interface edge between the
outer atmosphere and outer space. This boundary represents the outer edge of our biosphere or its limit. It is
thought that we are approaching the limits of the biosphere’s ability to deal with carbon dioxide as an output
from the human economy. Boundary is therefore a critical principle for understanding and communicating
about climate change.

Intralevel Communication
Because PD patterns are at this stage culturally neutral symbols, they can be associated with images and
words that resonate with different altitudes. This gives us two important strategic advantages for talking
about climate change. Firstly, it brings a principle like “boundary as limit” into the discussion. If everyone
can agree that limits exist in principle, then we have a basis for discussion. In contrast, if limits are denied as a
concept, then it is difficult to talk meaningfully about climate change on any level. Secondly, by illuminating
the principles though the use of neutral patterns in association with images and words meaningful to different
levels of altitude, we have the basis for intralevel discussions.

In my experience, people at amber altitude tend to relate to the principles represented by the patterns as com-
mon sense. As in, “It’s just common sense that farms with animals need fences.” People at orange altitude
tend to view them in economic terms, as in the boundaries of a franchise area or the limits to budgetary
expenditure. Green altitude marks the point where people identify the patterns primarily in nature (as in
ecosystem boundaries and ecological edges), while those at teal altitude seem to see principles as conceptual
realities at all levels of the domains of self, culture, and nature. Turquoise altitude experiences the patterns as
glimpses of the subtle archetypal organizing habits of a Kosmos infused with living presence.

I do not have evidence to support the descriptions above except for personal observations and limited feed-
back from people conversant with PD. Nonetheless, my own intralevel communication attempts using the
association method above seem to work quite effectively.

PatternDynamics™ Methodology
I have also developed a simple methodology so Integral Sustainability leaders can have comprehensive dis-
cussions about sustainability issues in combination with the AQAL framework. In this sense, the PD patterns
could be thought of as a set of horizontal perspectives that can be applied to add more nuance and detail to
sustainability topics located within the broader Integral framework. This methodology has a simple three-part
formula: 1) we scan to identify the patterns related to the topic under discussion; 2) we evaluate and prioritize

                                                           Journal of Integral Theory and Practice—Vol. 5, No. 1   17

the patterns for their relevance to the issue at hand; and 3) we balance and integrate for health.

Doing a PD scan helps to make sure we are touching base with all of the important aspects of a sustainability
issue. Going back to climate change, scanning for all of the relevant patterns could include a multitude of pat-
terns from the PD chart. I will include System, Energy, Cycle, Balance, Growth, Complexity, Flows/Stores,
Inputs/Outputs, Swing, Pulse, Feedback, and Holarchy. Without going into the PD definition of each of these
patterns, it should be clear that most of them have some relevance to climate change. Many of these words
are used to talk about sustainability and climate change at conferences, in the media, and among sustainability
professionals. Mostly this is done in an ad hoc way, except within a few specific systems disciplines where
there is a consistency of terminology. There is a general, but inconsistent, systems “lingua franca” at work in
sustainability, and part of what PD does is to provide a simple, consistent framework for communicating in
sustainability using systems language. This is similar to how the AQAL model allows experts from divergent
disciplines to share a language and have new kinds of conversations that were not possible before. The hope
is that PD, or something like it, can be adopted widely enough to provide us with a kind of global sustain-
ability literacy.

Scanning helps to make sure we do not get stuck in limited perspectives, but most of the time it is not useful to
include all of the possible patterns. Evaluating the evidence supporting the importance of each pattern allows
us to prioritize the most important ones. Everyone will read the evidence differently, but the important factor
is that no important perspective has been ignored. In other words, we are having a comprehensive conversa-
tion with the intention of integrating truths in an effective manner. Having evaluated the evidence support-
ing the importance of the patterns listed above, I have chosen four to raise a point for discussion: Boundary,
Input/Output, Growth, and Swing. I have combined them into a composite meta-pattern that illustrates a
dynamic pattern that I think may be at work in climate change (see Fig. 7).

As discussed above, the Boundary pattern illustrates the principle that we live in a limited environment. The
Input/Output pattern represents the principle that all systems are embedded in larger systems. In this case, it
is the economy that is embedded in the biosphere; it is dependent on receiving inputs like oil, gas, coal, ore

                   Figure 7. Individual PatternDynamics™ pattern combined into a meta-pattern.

bodies, water, plants, and animals from the biosphere and also for dispersing outputs like carbon dioxide,
methane, heat, water vapor, other industrial pollutants, and sewage into the biosphere. The growth pattern
demonstrates the principle of natural exponential growth, in this instance of the human industrial economy.
The Swing pattern illustrates the principle of extremes (i.e., polarized situations that are often destructive and
difficult to maintain).

Putting these patterns together into a larger meta-pattern represents my belief that people advocating the
extreme AGW view may have an unhealthy fixation with destructive outputs of the economy. I state this for
a few reasons. First, the extreme AGW view ignores some very good evidence about the decline in inputs
to the economy as a major threat to civilization. Second, there is also good evidence to support the fact that
there simply is not enough available oil, gas, and coal to output enough carbon dioxide to create the danger-
ous levels factored into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes climate models (Aleklett, 2007).
Finally, I think that, like my own initial perspective in sustainability, the extreme AGW view is fixed on LR
quadrant ecosystems from the perspective of green altitude. The mono focus, hypersensitivity, anxiety, and
fear that are often generated from this view may be creating an unwarranted extreme position. You might ask
why this is a problem if we need to curb industrial growth anyway?

The extreme AGW view, which is currently driving climate change discussions, is causing a culture war. I do
not think the evidence is strong enough for a position this extreme, and I believe many people not at green
altitude feel the same way. Leveraging this view could turn out to be a very destructive strategy. Moreover,
we need to ask ourselves if there are possible downsides to being wrong about the extreme AGW hypothesis.
What if the biosphere actually can tolerate higher carbon dioxide emissions? Is it then ethically tenable to
stymie the developing world’s use of coal? Will this eliminate an effective strategy for a sustainable future by
condemning the bulk of the world’s population to poverty and ethnocentric levels of altitude? I am not at all
sure that my assertions based on the patterns above are correct, but I am sure that it is a better way to have the
conversation—far better, I think, than reacting from the fear and anxiety of a limited perspective.

Conclusion
I will conclude with a few remarks about the fear and anxiety I have seen around sustainability projects.
Foremost, I think our fears are rooted in an inability to predict and manage the level of complexity we have
created in developed nations. Unmanageable global, dynamic systemic complexity and the threat of collapse
are getting the better of us, and this uncertainty is generating unprecedented levels of underlying, existential
fear. A key to dealing effectively with this complexity and alleviating our anxiety and fear lies in the last ele-
ment of the PD methodology: balance and integrate for health.

Complexity by its very nature overwhelms the human capacity to know it and manage it. My proposition is
that we do not have to deal with it that way. The systemic processes on planet Earth have been guided by an
inherent systemic organizing capacity for health and development since the dawn of evolution. If this were
not true, we would not be here. This process is natural and we can work with it simply by removing the block-
ages that hinder its development. The best way to do this is to learn to identify the natural dynamic patterns
of organization at work in our world and then to balance them where they are unhealthy (by bringing them
back from some extreme) and integrate them where they are missing. The rest will take care of itself. With an

Integral approach, we have the capacity to make the sustainable transition an opportunity in the development
of human culture and an emergence of evolutionary possibilities. I believe also that global pattern literacy has
a role to play in the unity of action required for enduring health on our small planet.

Ken, II, MI and the State of My Integral Enterprise

       “Techniques employ four qualities that reflect the nature of our world.
       Depending on the circumstances, you should be: hard like a diamond, flexible
       as a willow, smooth-flowing like water or empty as space.”
                                                       Morihei Ushiba (1972, p. 71)

In writing this piece I’m feeling a little like the guy who asks what might be a really
dumb question in an auditorium full of really smart people. Intuitively, deep in my
gut, I feel like I need to start a conversation, but I’m not really confident about how
it’s going to go. I can’t stop myself from putting my hand up, and, now that I’m
speaking into the mic, I’m getting those cold sweats down my spine and my stomach
is in a knot.
I’m not sure I’m necessarily the most qualified person to start this, and I’m not even
sure it’s going to be as important to you as it is to me, but, if it is, then it’ll be worth
the risk. And, I’m prepared to be flat out wrong about how to go about this. Starting
this conversation is not just about the ‘Integral community’–to a large degree it’s also
about my own journey in Integral and my need, at this particular time, to try and make
sense of what is going on and what I’m doing within the Integral space.
The question at the heart of this conversation, for me–and this is what I’ve been
struggling with for a while now–is exactly how do we find meaning in what has gone
down with the ‘Integral Enterprise’ to date. What happened to all the promise, the
confidence, the potential for the more evolved organisation of the larger movement
itself? How did we get to this underwhelming state of affairs when we were meant to
be so fricken onto it–when our whole raison d’etre is that we think we have a better
way of doing this sort of thing?
Big Containers
I’m not talking about all of the great people and organisations using Integral theory in
really useful and interesting ways, and I’m not talking about the many extraordinary
practitioners and truly beautiful people in our community. I’m talking about the big
container, or at least bigger containers, that I believe are meant to hold these
initiatives and people in an integrated embrace. Why is it that at the wider
‘integrating’ level it feels so much like Integral has failed to live up to its potential,
and, I might add, its considerable hype? What does this mean to each of us and to
what we share through our participation in Integral?
Do we even need these big containers? I would argue that we do. One of the major
things we agree on in Integral as a community is that interiors have exterior correlates
and visa versa. So, while it is tempting to give up on the idea of Integral ‘institutions’,
given what we have seen so far, I don’t think we can realize the potential of Integral
consciousness to be of service in the world if we, if fact, do that. So, the ‘we’ I’m
referring to is not just the Integral community at large, more specifically it’s those of
us in the Integral community who see the need for more complex, more
comprehensive types of organisations, but who want to see more functional,
supportive and enlightened ones–those of us who still think this is a worthy, if not
essential, pursuit. It is understandable if you feel a little (or a lot) outside of this big
container ‘we’ at the moment. Initially, I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to be a part of
that ‘we’. This article is about how I did and the processes that brought me there.
There is an element of rationalisation in all this as well. I have made a commitment, a
deep commitment, to participate in an attempt to create one of these bigger containers,
but one that I think can actually be the kind of supportive, evolved, liberating
structure that I hoped would be the norm. I think the dynamics associated with the
failure to date to create these bigger structures in the ways we imagined them has
caused a lot of hurt. Hurt to individuals, to reputations, to organisations, to initiatives
and to the movement itself through a serious loss of confidence in our belief that
anything Integral can actually make a real difference, not just in isolated instances
(where I think it does), but in the wider world. How can it possibly if we can’t even
get it right in our own community? If you haven’t guessed, I’m talking largely about
dynamics many (myself included) feel to be have been associated with Integral
Institute. To be fair, these same patterns can also been seen elsewhere in the Integral
space. So, right now, being involved with these bigger projects in Integral seems
tainted and risky, like their very nature might be to start with good intentions and big
statements and then to degenerate into unnecessary exclusivity, unmet expectation,
neglect, turf wars, power politics and empire building.
Being sure about why I should make a commitment to getting this big container thing
right is difficult, and I feel more than a little vulnerable. I do, though, feel like I need
to make sense of what has happened in the past, what is likely to be possible and not
possible in the future, and to share this with all of you before my full capacity is going
to show up.
I realised recently that I’ve been telling myself a story about all this– making it up and
repeating it and shaping it into some sort of meaning. The most effective way I can
think of to start this inquiry is to just tell that story as an invitation for further
conversation and as a process for collectively making meaning.

MetaIntegral (MI)
I think it’s clear that there is now a widespread, real, and deep distrust (which I partly
share) of any attempt to put in place these bigger structures. Why then do I feel so
strongly about participating in the development of MetaIntegral (MI), an unabashedly
big container that Sean Esbjorn-Hargens is founding in an attempt to make the
integral space healthier in Integral?
The answer to this is partly a Douglas Adams type sentiment. Simply, that every
Tupperware set needs a few big containers. You know, the one’s you can fit lots of
the other smaller containers into when you go on a picnic or a camping trip. It’s the
integral idea in a nutshell, really. Put simply, I still believe in Integral (and in the
more generalised ‘integral arising’), and I think we need to get this right to sustain
that belief.
Partly it’s that my experience to date, with Sean and within the nascent MetaIntegral
organisation–which I will speak more about later–has been to find the kind of space,
the kind of services and the kind of support that I wanted from the institution building
projects in Integral. I’m writing this piece in part to introduce and advocate for
MetaIntegral. I like what I see so far. I think there is a need for it, and I am making a
commitment to it. On that basis, I’m going to make a case for supporting it and for
why I think it’s different; but, if it turns out, in my view, not to demonstrate a healthy
expression of ‘the big container’, I will equally apply my efforts to working out why
and to letting you know about it.
What I’ve experienced so far with regard to MI wasn’t enough though. Somehow that
feeling and my trust in Sean were not going to allow me to fully surrender my
resistance to this sort of project. I also had to make sense of a whole range of things
that were bothering me through creating the story I mentioned above–a kind of
meaning making narrative or mythos that I’ll start by telling you a bit about my own.

What I’m Going to Tell and How
In this telling I’m going to try and do a few things. I’m going to try and make sense of
Ken Wilber. Not in a comprehensive way (I might be a little impulsive, but I’m not
nuts), just enough to tease apart a few distinctions that helped me come to terms with
my perceptions. I’ll have a go at the same for Integral Institute and its general design
and function. Again, not in any sort of clinical way, but just enough to string together
this story. And, I’m going to attempt to do this, in part, using bits of my own budding
initiative, which is an Integral Pattern Language useful for this type of narrative
building. Along the way we will do some compare and contrast between how I
perceive MI vs II, some of the Patterns they share, ones they don’t, ones I think we
need, and what a difference I think a shift in perspective can make.
At this point I’ll introduce PatternDynamics (PD)–my Integral application. (See
www.patterndynamics.com.au) Technically I refer to it as an Integral Sustainability
Pattern Language. It forms, to switch from the Tupperware metaphor, an element
within the emerging MetaIntegral ecosystem. It’s useful for shifting conversations to
a ‘systems view’, or more fully perhaps to a ‘perspectival systems view’ (which is one
of the ways that I tend to think of integral capacity). From there, collectively, we can
gain some objectivity on dynamics we may be immersed in or are only able to sense
emotionally or intuitively. This is the same subject/object move that we get through
using the AQAL elements. In this case, instead of having five AQAL elements
(oriented as a theoretical framework) we also have 56 PD Patterns (oriented more as a
semiotic process: a conversation). Like the AQAL elements, all of the Patterns are
generally observable types or forms of organisation that help us make distinctions
where we may not have been able to do so before.
For the more theoretically minded–you can skip this paragraph if you’re not–I view
the AQAL framework as representative of a set (but by no means the set) of
foundational ‘patterns of organisation’ or ‘types’ or ‘forms’. These are what I refer to
as meta-types: observable general forms that seem to pop up literally everywhere. I
also view the AQAL framework, from a big-picture, historical development vantage
point, as an approach to the wider integral impulse with a distinctly first person
orientation. For me, more than anything else, it’s been a visionary and truly profound
theory cooked up in Wilber’s first person and transmitted to our first persons. I think
of AQAL Integral as being associated with a distinctly first person, interior
‘understanding’ and personal development type orientation. I’m not saying that’s all it
is, only that it feels very much like that’s its native orientation. All of which is fine. In
fact, I think this dynamic, and this is part of the story, has been essential for having
anything we refer to as Integral at all. But, at this stage, and this is a theme to which
we will return, I think it is appropriate to explore just what a more second person,
community development, developmental orientation might look like within our
capital ‘I’ Integral. That’s why I’m interested in language as an approach to Integral;
Integral as a capacity for conversation and story and meaning as well as a theory or
theories. All of this is tied up with my own thinking on meta-types and the perceived
need to start shifting our emphasis from a first person, theoretical, vertical,
evolutionary focus to include a more second person, community emphasising,
horizontal, health orientated focus. If you want to start in on that conversation then
you can check out this paper, Creating Cultures of Sustainability, by clicking Winton

My Story
Ok, back to the story. This isn’t the first time I’ve been a participant in movements
that have undergone the kind of dynamic I’m talking about: where theory failed, at
least in the first instance, to translate into the kind of community reality that the
particular theory postulated. I’ve been a practitioner and community member of both
Aikido (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) (a Japanese martial art referred to as ‘the
art of peace’) and permaculture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)(a global
sustainability design and lifestyle movement) for the last 20 years. Like Integral, both
have powerful and charismatic founders, Morihei Ushiba
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihei_Ueshiba) and Bill Mollison
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) respectively; both claim to have methods
that will dramatically improve things for humankind if practiced widely. In the case
of permaculture, it has two founders–the other, and equal partner, being David
Holmgren (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Holmgren) –however, it was Mollison
who evangelised permaculture as an ideal in sustainable global community living.

In both cases when it comes to the larger scale organisation of the communities of
practitioners themselves, I’ve witnessed the same old kinds of ego trips, power plays,
political manoeuvring, poor behaviour and community dysfunction that I’ve
experience outside these disciplines. Sound familiar? In limited instances and in
limited scope both can and have produced demonstrative improvements in some
aspects of human affairs, but not widely enough, even within their own communities,
to serve as exemplars that drive an uptake within the mainstream of society that
fundamentally alters it. Were their founders actually able to demonstrate this
personally and within their own communities? It doesn’t actually seem to matter. I
didn’t know Morihei Ushiba since he died two years after I was born, but my feeling
is that while perhaps he could be difficult and enigmatic, he was indeed the kind of
figure who walked his talk and was revered for it. I do know Bill, and I do not think
this is true of him. Much of the time I thought his behaviour seemed to demonstrate
exactly the opposite of how you might go about building sustainable community. But
that’s another story. You can read about that one here in An Integral Permaculture.
(www.thepatternguy.com/2012/05/21/an-integral-permaculture/)
I’m a fairly practical sort of bloke, so my interest has been primarily in testing the
theory of these two disciplines through embodied practice and application to ‘real life
situations’. I’ve done the same with Integral Theory. What I found was that some of
the grander claims, not necessarily all made by their founders–often by their closer
followers–were not in fact able to be substantiated. After road testing permaculture as
a complete and viable strategy for sustainable community living during a ten-year
residential education centre experiment, I concluded that it was not. But, this has been
one of its major claims and what sold me on the idea in the first place. (This probably
speaks as much to my naivety as to shortcomings in the discipline, but there you go.)
This failure along with the above mentioned all too human behaviour and what
seemed like an almost pathological tendency to perpetuate this myth on other
unsuspecting but well intentioned people, caused me to completely fall out of love
with permaculture for a while. This was especially so because along the way I took a
few hard knocks and at times felt bruised and bloodied from trying to put in place
something that was promoted as a practical ideal, but that the theory could not really
support. Adding Integral theory and practice to permaculture in this instance did,
however, yield some real and tangible improvements to the project. It’s one of the
main reasons I still have faith in the ability of integral approaches to make a real
difference in the world. That story is available in From Deep Green to Second Tier:
Sustainability at the Threshold (www.thepatternguy.com/2012/05/21/from-deep-
green-to-second-tier-sustainability-at-the-threshold/)
After some time and some distance away from that crucible, I was able to look at the
situation a little more objectively. I was able to see permaculture’s strengths and
weaknesses and to take stock of what I learned and what did actually work. Practicing
permaculture is where I gained the skills to work in sustainability education,
ecological design, forestry and organic agriculture–vocations that I think are useful
and that I truly love. Also, through Mollison and Holmgren’s focus on natural patterns
and principles, it became the foundation--along with aspects of Aikido, a lot of time
in nature, architectural design, complexity and systems theories--for the ‘perspectival’
systems awareness that I brought along to my Integral turn and subsequently used to
develop PatternDynamics.
In comparison, road testing Aikido turned out to be relatively simple. Despite what
you might read on martial arts forums and despite having trained mostly in one of the
‘softer’ styles of the art, there is a police video somewhere that illustrates that if you
are inclined to neutralise an attacker then Aikido works well enough ‘in the street’. I
also think it is unsurpassed as a body/mind integration discipline. It wasn’t the
stitches in my lip from my street encounter that hurt when it came to Aikido. It was
the disappointment of witnessing masters I revered and trusted dispute, in ways that
should have been well beneath them, who had rights to what pieces of the art of
peace. Sadly, I’ve encountered similar stories through conversations with aikidoka
from around the world.
One of the things I’ve taken away from these experiences is that theory is one thing
and practice is another–especially with regard to the wider community of
practitioners. For me, there is clearly a pattern at work in all this. In the world of
theory there is no requirement to demonstrate its practicality. The cut and thrust takes
place behind a computer terminal or at conferences. I don’t want to downplay the kind
of intersubjective violence to reputations, feelings, livelihoods and such that can go
on here, but for me it’s in putting theory into practice, especially at the larger scales,
that one encounters, shall we say, a fuller spectrum and deeper experience of the
proverbial rough and tumble.

Sensing the Field
My sense of the general sentiment in the Integral ‘field’ at the moment is that there
are quite a few of us who are feeling, to one degree or another, underwhelmed,
distrusting, disappointed, disenchanted or, in fact, bruised and bloodied by our initial
period of practice, as a community. What interests me about the Integral dynamic at
this time, and what has helped me to story this in a way that makes me want to
continue, is that there are archetypal patterns at work. Uncovering those stories has
helped me to acknowledge how I’m feeling emotionally and also to shift my
perspective so I can view things more objectively. As a collection of stories, as
patterns that have been repeated many times in the past–as a set of cultural meta-
types–it all starts to make a little more sense.
Looking at it this way, it’s much easier to resist some critics’ views that Ken Wilber is
somehow defective, Integral is defective, its big institutions are flag waving,
inherently exploitative empire building enterprises or ‘look-at-me clubs’. And,
therefore by association with them, I’m defective, and that the whole thing just isn’t
going to work the way we thought. Some of this criticism is undoubtedly partly valid,
however the flaws in Integral are most likely not congenital. Having worked through
some of this stuff now, I don’t feel like that is the case at all, and, frankly that’s a big
relief. Like many of you, I’ve invested a lot of life energy and identity in being a part
of Integral.
I’m going to start to tell that more archetypal story now–at least the story as I see it.
Again, it’s not my intention to tell you the story. I’m putting this out there as a
process that is working for me, and that can serve to start a conversation that might
help to do the same thing collectively. I’m going to use both PD Patterns and AQAL
Perspectives to do this. To give this method the best chance of success, we are going
to have to touch on just a couple more aspects of theory. You see, even in promoting a
more second person, culturally orientated approach, I’m going to have to use a little
first person orientated theory. That is the first bit of theory: even thought it might be
appropriate to orient around one perspective to explore or explain a given situation,
we are still going to have to work multiple perspectives. The point is to be able to
‘shift’ these perspectives as necessary–focusing on the shifting as much as the
perspectives themselves. The same requirement for shifting is true of the Patterns,
which we will get to in a moment. Secondly, it’s all about balancing and integrating
these Patterns and Perspectives in a given situation to enable ‘generative health’–what
my good friend and Integral colleague, Will Vary, refers to as ‘Apithology’. (See
www.apithology.org).
Ken
The first Pattern I’m going to introduce is one that will be familiar: the Holon. I’m
doing it to help us discuss the story of Ken. When I said I was going to try and make
sense of Ken Wilber, I didn’t mean so much Ken the person, I meant more Ken the
figure. I don’t know him personally and our few communications have been short and
mostly one way, so I won’t be focusing on that, although, I will have a few things to
say based on what I have experienced. I’m doing this because I think we need to find
a story for Ken, one that allows us, the community, to put him in the proper
relationship to the constellation of Integral activities and its overall development. If
not, we will be stuck trying to work out how we feel about Ken, and by extension
Integral Institute, as a series of subjective and intersubjective judgements, and we will
not be able to look at these things more objectively and therefore move on. This kind
of collective ‘object making’ is the whole point of the larger story I’m trying to tell
here, but I think it is most important with regard to Ken, given the magnitude of his
presence with regard to Integral as a whole.

                           Click here to see a fuller description of the Holon Pattern
The two inner ovals of the Holon Pattern above represent systems that are parts of a
larger system, signified by the enveloping larger oval. Each of the three ovals also has
an inside and an outside symbolising the subjective and objective aspects of any
part/whole ‘system’. The inclusion of the cross is an acknowledgement that Ken came
up with this holon as part/whole/subject/object insight, which I think might just prove
to be the contemporary equivalent of inventing the wheel in terms of how it ultimately
serves humanity. This inclusion also acknowledges that he created the quadrant
symbol to help represent the holon. This last part, creating a diagram or a ‘Pattern’ to
represent a foundational ‘pattern of organization’, perhaps the most foundational
pattern of organization, or what I mentioned earlier I refer to as a meta-type, seems
less important, in this case, than the theory of the holon itself. It is architect
Christopher Alexander, founder of the concept of Pattern Languages, who relates the
full power of this act when he states in his earliest book on the subject, Notes on the

### Synthesis of Form:

        “… I found that the diagrams themselves had immense power, and that, in
       fact, most of the power of what I had written lay in the power of these
       diagrams.” (Alexander, 1964, preface)
That said, you will notice how my Holon Pattern is a softer, more shapely, more
feminine, more relational and more horizontally emphasizing signifier of the nature of
the holon.
So what does this have to do with Ken? Well the first part of the story is that some of
the features of Ken’s behaviour, as they relate to the Integral community at large, can
be characterized through a particular orientation to the holon. What I mean by this is
that his actions tend to gravitate to the very agentic, ‘part’ aspect of the holon, and
also to the interior side of things. We don’t need to get stuck on this. I certainly don’t
think Ken does, but it does look like it’s been his basic orientation to the holon as it
relates to his work in Integral. This is precisely the very powerful and agentic first
person approach I alluded to earlier that enabled Ken in creating Integral theory, in
passing it on to us, and then in launching it as a potentially historically important
cultural force. I don’t think this sort of thing happens very successfully by committee,
or by folks with less robust interior capacity, so it’s just as well. This is Ken as
Master–capital ‘M’. The Master we sought out in the beginning, the Master we
revered for the awesomeness of this capacity, and the Master, truth be known, we
projected our bright shadows onto and fell in love with, turbo charging the launch of
Integral in direct proportion to the magnitude of his offering, which was, in both
cases, really very large.

So far, so good: Ken as Master looks like a good fit–a pattern and a perspective
balanced and integrated to serve the process at hand. I don’t think this is as true for
the next part of the story. Once Ken had formed his theory suitably and given it that
all mighty push into the world with the help of initial supporters, I sensed that things
subtly started to change. This is especially true of the development of the initiatives of
Integral Institute, Ken’s main institutional vehicle and Integral’s first and most central
‘big container’.
Integral Institute
The next Pattern I’m going to introduce is Hierarchy. The composition of the diagram
itself illustrates the meta-type it represents: a wide base at the bottom, concentrated
power at the top, all held in a very stable and somewhat rigid configuration.

                       Click here to see a fuller description of the Hierarchy Pattern
I still remember the excitement I felt around some of the earlier initiatives announced
by the newly formed Integral Institute (II): the Multiplex
(http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/71), the emergence of Integral Naked
(http://www.integralnaked.org/) and the Seminars run by various centres within II, to
name just a few of what seemed like a steady fount of big ideas and bigger projects.
By the time I attended the first Integral Ecology and Sustainability Seminar
(http://www.world-wire.com/news/0716040001.html) hosted by II at the Westin
Hotel near Boulder in 2004, it was clear that many folks had gathered and were
continuing to gather to work with Ken and II. Some of them had clearly uprooted
their lives and moved to do just that. The promise of Integral at that stage was big
enough that part of me wanted to do the same thing. It’s exactly what I did when I
went to train with Bill Mollison early in my permaculture days, but this time I had
learned enough to see the wisdom in a little more distance.
Even having invested in travelling all the way from Australia to attend the seminar, I
was prepared to be somewhat underwhelmed. I was not; the folks who organized this
event and the folks who turned up, people like Barrett Brown
(http://www.kosmosjournal.org/bios/barrett-c-brown), Gail Hochachka
(http://integralwithoutborders.org/team), Cynthia McEwan
(http://www.voiceamerica.com/guest/5640/cynthia-mcewen), John Schmidt
(http://integrallife.com/contributors/john-schmidt), David Johnston,
(http://integrallife.com/contributors/david-johnston) Sean Esbjön-Hargens (link to be
added) and many others gave me an experience of Integral and of that community that
made me feel like I’d finally found my people. Ken spoke to us twice. It was clear
enough to me then that while he was a Master worth seeking out, there was not going
to be a whole lot of Grandma Zen going around when you were close to him, if you
know what I mean. That is fine with me. I’d worked out through my previous
experiences that the idea I had in my head about how it would be to work with these
sorts of Masters, was not necessarily how Masters worked. Ken, in my view, clearly
has a genuinely and profoundly Big Heart, but it was also clear that his very powerful
presence and agency would have the biggest influence on the form of II as an
organization. Integral Institute always felt like a kingdom to me and that’s why I
introduced the Hierarchy Pattern–Ken as Master in the concentrated seat of power and
influence at the top of the unyielding Kingdom of II.
As I add Patterns to this story (like the nice looking ones above that I prepared earlier:
Holon and Hierarchy) I’m also going to add them together in mono-colour hand
drawn composites that represent the story as a whole. This is to illustrate how the
Patterns can be used in this type of conversation (without having to be an expert at
Adobe Illustrator) and to encourage some of you to look through the Patterns and
Charts on www.patterndynamics.com.au to use them to engage in the conversation as
you see it. It’s also to demonstrate that the Patterns themselves are more like elements
of an alphabet and that it’s the way they are compiled into larger units of meaning that
makes them a language.

                               Meta-type: Master of the Kingdom
Master and Apprentice
By the time I attended my second seminar in 2006 at the now familiar Westin Hotel, I
sensed a real shift in the Integral communities’ relationship to Ken. Boomeritis, his
tongue in cheek critique of extreme postmodernism by way of a novel, had been
published since 2002. In the meantime there had been building what can only be
described as an online war with some of his critics. Not all of the conflict was around
Ken’s views on the pathologies of what he thought of as a deep narcissism infecting
parts of the postmodern baby boomer generation, but this general critique of it did
seem to be the fuel that fed the fire. Things at Integral Institute also appeared to be in
disarray. At the time of the seminar the previous CEO of II had just departed in less
than convivial circumstances, some of the other folk involved in II appeared to be in
fire fighting mode and others were clearly dismayed and rethinking their involvement.
I’ve always interpreted these goings on, both online and off, as the result of Ken
trying to make distinctions between what was Integral and what was a lesser
interpretation of Integral that threatened the integrity of the system.
If you are interested in Integral Theory in any way, this is just something you have to
come to terms with. It’s a lot easier for many of us to turn a blind eye to this difficult
and somewhat awkward reality and to remain in the warmer, fuzzier world of
pluralistic, egalitarian beliefs and values. Grandma Zen might allow you to stay there,
but not Ken Zen. Masters are not in the business of making you comfortable. They are
in the business of shifting your awareness.
Some of you may find this part of my story somewhat controversial, but I think what
Ken did here was necessary; and, now that the hard work in making this bigger
distinction has been done, it is something that needs to be maintained in a myriad of
smaller ways within our community. This has always been a real Jesus-chasing-the-
money-changers-from-the-temple kind of effort for me. And–we crucified him for it.
I think this period in the history of Integral illustrates one of the main dynamics in our
relationship to Ken. Ken, perhaps harshly or unskilfully or heroically, depending on
your perspective, making repeated efforts to cut out those who would seek to debase
the system–at least as he saw it; and then a larger and larger group of us being uneasy,
then dismayed then horrified at the consequences. Clearly he has his supporters, and
there are enough of them acting in good faith that they cannot be discounted, nor can
the truth, however partial, associated with these actions be denied.
Now we need to tease apart Ken’s actions as Integral Big Heart from Ken as a human
being–a human being, like the rest of us, with flaws. This story is not about white
washing flaws in Ken’s behaviour. Far from it: clearly there have been some and they
can look mighty big, but that is the whole point, and it brings us to the crux and core
of our story. Are we Integral critics, the authentic ones, going to have the courage and
humility to stand up, to do our best in carrying on the lineage, and to know that it is
inevitable that we will make mistakes, and that our flaws will also be magnified and
that, in this, other people will hang their dark shadows onto us in the same way we
have hung them on Ken? Will we be grounded enough, also, to resist the temptation
to exploit the energy of the bright shadow?
The real story here is the archetypal story of the Master and the apprentice: first we
revere her and seek her out, then we learn from her, then we see her flaws and
limitations. Given that an immediate cure for the human condition seems unlikely,
and given that progress has only ever been made through learning from mistakes, are
we, then, ready to emerge from the Master’s shadow–or, rather, our own shadow, the
shadow we have hung on the Master–and face this inevitability? Is there not some
truth in this in relation to how we collectively feel about Ken and II? Are we not to
some degree projecting onto the Master what it means to step into our own mastery?
Am I not? Are we ready to own this? If we are, then the story goes something like
this: Ken is a Master with a big Big Heart and also a human being with flaws, who
being aware of these two realities, the inevitability of mistakes, and the inevitability
of the projections he would face, subjected himself knowingly to the slings and
arrows for the good of the greater whole, as he saw it. Now each of us can evaluate
the need for these actions and the elegance, or lack thereof, by which they were
executed, but, if we are honest with ourselves, it is now a lot harder to think that Ken
was not acting in good faith, with authenticity and, indeed, with a very Big Heart.
You might think it is a flawed Big Heart, but keep in mind, they all are. The
alternative story, that Ken’s personality is somehow defective and that he is
profoundly unaware of what he was doing, just does not make enough sense–by itself.
Transcend and Include
                        Click here to see a fuller description of the Emergence Pattern
This is all a part of Emergence, the next Pattern I would like to introduce. Collectively
we are called into the advanced stages of emerging as Masters in our own right–it’s
that time. As the Pattern above signifies, this emergence takes elements of previous
systems (the little squares) and ‘pops’ them to a new level (indicated by the arrows),
creating a new form (the oval). This story illustrates the classic developmental
sequence. First we identify with a given level–the level we are trying to master–then
we have to dis-identify with that level as the necessary start to transcending it. Then if
all goes well, we swing back around and include what we dis-identified with and then
emerge as a healthy integrated, much different and hopefully more complex whole. If
we don’t, well, then we have a shadow. And, really, do we want the figure of Ken
lurking around in our collective basement? That would be way worse than
underwhelming–way, way worse! Developing the awareness to find a story for Ken
that contains enough truth to allow us to embrace him as we transcend him is a much
better option. I’m not interested so much in whether this is the story of Ken, as
finding out what is, through the sum of our perspectives. I might be wrong about the
amount of truth in this story, but what I do know is that however we collectively story
Ken as a figure in Integral, we do in fact need a story, and we need to agree on its
truth. So, if you think I am off base, please treat this as an invitation to discover your
truth and to tell that story.

                                                 Meta-type: Emerging from the Master

So, the answer to my initial question is that we arrived here because to one degree or
another it’s where you arrive in the development of a movement when the community
as a whole begins to transcend the original Master. Yes, I still think it’s accurate to
describe Integral as a movement, and, yes, things might have gone better, but they
could also have been a lot worse. Our ‘we’ actually exists, and that is no small feat.
And, yes, the big container thing has not met our expectations with regard to all the
hype around what Integral was going to achieve. It might also be interesting at this
point to ask why, if we felt the big container wasn’t working out, didn’t we do
something about it? Why did we just default to the idea that Ken was the only one
who could do this sort of thing?
Hype and the Energy of the Bright Shadow
My biggest criticism of the behaviour of Ken and II is all the hype. It’s really just
borrowing from future successes and therefore borrowing from the community. In this
case, it also amplified a very powerful dynamic–what I’m going to call the ‘energy of
the bright shadow’. This is when we give our energy, resources and attention by
projecting our higher potentials onto a figure, or figures, that we think represent the
realization of those potentials. Working with this energy is always risky, potentially
dangerous, and susceptible to abuse. It requires a strong duty of care. The projectees,
it must be said, must also take responsibility for their half of this dynamic. Sometimes
it’s worth borrowing to boost an enterprise along–that is what good credit systems
should really be all about. The energy of the bright shadow may also be able to be
used skilfully, if balanced and integrated to serve the enduring health of both the
individuals involved and of the system as a whole. So, I don’t so much have a
problem with how Ken and II generated the hyperbole around the initial launch of
Integral. I was willing to entertain the idea that tipping this balance to such an
extreme was timely and in service of an extremely good idea. But, I think this
somehow became a general modus operandi and that there have been a few too many
folks in and around II (and in fact more generally in the Integral scene) dipping into
the same community credit, but without the same sort of justification or capacity to
pay back. What seems like a much larger associated problem (again, I carry this
perspective because of some of my previous experiences–particularly Mollison’s
hyping of permaculture and the sycophants that he attracted) was the lack of
discrimination about the acceptance and use of the energy of the bright shadow. This
too seems to have become a general MO within parts of the Integral community, some
tapping this flow through an association with Ken, and some by emulating him as
proclaimed master of a particular sub-kingdom of Integral. This is, of course, not true
of everyone involved in II or with Ken or in Integral at large. It’s just one of those
orienting generalizations that helps us along the way.
If Ken was going to go booting people out of the temple, then perhaps it would have
been better if he located folks engaged in these other, more insidious, forms of
debasement–or empowered people who could. Because this did not happen, we lost
our innocence and Integral Institute lost a big chunk of its credibility.
This, I think, is closer to the real source of our distrust of the big container.
If it is true that the bigger the emotional charge for, or against, something, the greater
it is as an indicator of the amount of shadow at play, then we really have to examine
the energy around how the Integral community feels about Ken and II at the moment,
particularly in relation to both the period where we projected the bright shadow and
the period where we have hung the darker one.
I think, also, it is precisely because Integral has had a first person focus on theory
rather than a second person focus on conversation, meaning, values and culture that
how power should be used in our community has gone undiscussed–at lease in the
more ‘official’ forums–and has often not been handled well. A discussion on power,
whom should have it, how it is allocated, validated and substantiated, and how it gets
used is another story and another conversation the Integral community needs to have
sometime soon. I like to work on the basis that most people operate in good faith and
that bad outcomes are generally the result of mistakes. If, though, we agree that
something is a mistake, then any continued use of the sort of approach would
constitute, in my books, an abuse of power.
Strong words, I know, but it is hard to see how we are going to get anywhere by
apologising for the ongoing practice of that sort of thing. What I hope comes through
here is that I’m attempting to offer authentic criticism. Part of doing that is pointing
out it is actually ok to make mistakes (it’s inevitable) that mistakes were in fact made,
and that, for criticism to be of service, these mistakes should examined. Partly, it is
willing to be wrong, which I may be. And partly it is about being able to put things
within a larger perspective. What we are hoping Integral can do is to make a real
difference to how human beings relate to each other en mass. This has been the goal
of every purportedly beneficent cultural movement since the dawn of time. Progress
has been slow. If we make even a minor contribution, it will all be worth it. Deep
down, though, many of us believe we have something that can do better than that. If
so, this, in part at least, explains the very powerful energy we are working with, and,
no doubt, a fair chunk of the energy behind our collective shadow dynamics related to
Ken and II.
Community as Master
What I’ve come to now is that from a more dispassionate, more objective perspective
what has gone down in the Integral world to date fits with patterns we have seen
before and will most likely see again. Therefore, without denying the reality of the
situation, we shouldn’t be overly harsh on Ken or ourselves or anyone else–unless of
course the aforementioned negativities are perpetuated. The real question is, can we
step up as a community and make real improvements going forward? And if so, just
how do we do that?

My feeling is that it’s the Integral community at large that is emerging into mastery–
Community as Master. Like I said, there are many, many good examples of Integral
Theory being applied by individual practitioners and by groups on small and even
medium scales. Here, it is doing pretty much what we thought it would do. There are
also multiple examples of people who are taking Integral Theory further and making
Integral Application better than anything we saw in the beginning. For instance
Integral Coaching Canada has been a standout in both furthering Integral Theory and
its application. (https://www.integralcoachingcanada.com/) Integral Without Borders
is also doing great work (http://www.integralwithoutborders.org/). This is to name
just a few examples. Now it’s time to scale this activity up into bigger institutions,
and through that success demonstrate we really do have the capacity to make a
substantial and lasting contribution to human affairs. I think this will require that shift
from a first person ‘theoretical’ orientation to a more ‘cultural’ second person
orientation in the general design of the Integral enterprise.

                          Click here to see a fuller description of the Holarchy Pattern
This leads to the Holarchy Pattern. The nested series of holons illustrated in this
diagram signify a much more ecological pattern–systems within systems within
systems. Hierarchy is implied here–some ovals encompass others–but it’s subordinate
to the idea of ecology. An ecology is a system where there are many different niches
at many different scales. It’s an organising principle with more of a dynamic, co-
creative, participatory structure. Ecologies are also necessarily a blooming buzzing
network of signalling and multi-directional communications. The hierarchical nature
of II is a direct contrast to the principle Pattern that I see at work in MI, which is the
more ecologically orientated Holarchy Pattern. Keep in mind that the Holarchy
Pattern prescribes the framework of the greater system. You will find the same thing
with MetaIntegral. It is embedded in a conscious field that supports a particular kind
of ecosystem with a particular purpose. To find a niche there you will need to identify
with the consciousness of that purpose. MetaIntegral does not intend to be the big
container only a big container, one that might serve as a template for others. If MI
turns out to be a redwood forest and you are looking for more of a coastal wetland,
then you have a template for growing that type of holarchy. The more good ones the
better, I reckon.

                                          Meta-type: Transcendent Holarchy
The composite Pattern above signifies the meta-type (pattern of organisation or
principle of design) that results from the balancing of Hierarchy with Holarchy.
Hierarchy is not eliminated, but integrated (transcended and included) within a more
complex whole. And, Hierarchy is in no way bad here, it just needs to be balanced
with Holoarchy to serve the situation we find ourselves in now, which is not the
launch of a movement, but its growth and maturity.
In a way, I’m speaking to you as a kind of MetaIntegral guinea pig. Recently, Sean
Esbjörn-Hargens coached me as a certified coach of Integral Coaching Canada (one
of the aforementioned organizations working very effectively at the medium scale in
Integral). He has also mentored me, through the publishing process. In this coaching,
mentoring, and our further work together he encouraged and assisted me, along with
my long time collaborator Kamya O’keeffe, in developing PatternDynamics as an
Integral application. Sean also helped to deepen what I would call my integral
embodiment–my lived experience as an Integral practitioner. This was during the time
that Sean was developing the concept of MetaIntegral. My input was welcomed and,
in part, incorporated. It’s the two-way nature of my engagement with Sean and with
the development of MI, more than anything else, which gives me the confidence to
participate and to make such a deep commitment.
Dynamic Balance of the Feminine and the Masculine
MI is a space orientated to embodiment and application, to living integrally as a
practitioner and to creating effective applications of that embodiment. It is not a space
for commentary, but it is a space for conversations, conversations like this one that
serve, through a shift to a more second person orientation, to build the meaning,
values and the culture that support effective embodiment and application. In that way
I feel like MI brings a more grounded, more functional, more supportive, more
feminine balance to the design of our institutions. This relates to the descending arrow
in the Masculine/Feminine Pattern below. The ascending arrow signifies the more
agentic, more hierarchically driven, in many ways more exciting, but riskier dynamics
that have dominated Integral to date. The masculine arrow is like the vertical branches
of an olive tree: they shoot for the light and provide the energy for the tree, but they
bear no fruit. The feminine arrow represents the lower more horizontal branches that
carry less energy producing leaves but almost all of the fruit.

                      Click here to see a fuller description of the Masculine/Feminine
Pattern
It’s not the use of a more masculine or a more feminine principle that matters so much
as the capacity to balance and integrate these polarities as a method of ‘shifting’ that
enables generative health for a particular, and of course constantly shifting, context.
Everybody and everything needs a dynamic balance between generating energy and
using it creatively, agency and communion, Hierarchy and Holorchy. I think MI as a
proposition within Integral needs to, and does, enable a shift to a more feminine
orientation at this time, and I think it’s what we need. But, I also think MI embodies
the capacity to shift between these perspectives as needed, which is signified by the
intertwining of the masculine and feminine arrows in the Pattern diagram itself.

Meta-type: Balancing Polarity through Holarchy
The composite Pattern above represents a meta-type that I’ve called Balancing
Polarity through Holarchy. The addition of the descending and ascending
Masculine/Feminine Pattern arrows around the Holoarchy Pattern serves as a symbol
for one of the central design principles informing MetaIntegral as an Institution–the
capacity to balance and integrate masculine and feminie principles through the
embodiment of a transcendent holarchy.
Source
The last Pattern I want to include is Source.

                             Click here to see a fuller description of the Source Pattern
Source signifies the consciousness awareness that holds the origin and evolution of a
system’s identity and purpose . You can see the Source Pattern in the composite
above. It is the most central and foundational of all the Patterns. It is the same core
symbol as the Holon Pattern, and it shares the part/whole/inside/outside meaning as
an aspect of its own. The focus, though, is on the consciousness that brings awareness
to the unique nature of a particular holon or system. Without an awareness of a
system’s original identity and purpose; and, without an ability to balance changes to
that identity and purpose in a way that transcends but includes that origin, it will be
compromised at its core. Source, in this instance, represents the consciousness
required to integrate Ken, II and the history of Integral to date, into the evolution of
the collective meaning making of our communtiy. If we can do this in a balanced
way, it will enable the self-organising awareness of the individuals in the community
around that identity and purpose. If not, we will have related shadows and blockages.
Ken will remain the origin of the Integral community’s identity, but he is no longer
the main force in its evolution. That is up to us. Inevitably there will be a grieving
process associated with the loss of Ken as the main source of our identity and the
place where we hang our hopes, dreams, higher and lower selves. This grief must also
carry the resultant loss of our innocence as a community. I think this is a big part of
the feeling I’m describing in the field at the moment–to transcend is, in part, to
separate–to experience a loss. This needs to be acknowledged and we must work
through this grief without haste and in a way that allows the fullness of the process to
demonstrate itself. A key to this will be to raise the consciousness required to
acknowledge our origin so our relationship to it may be balanced, integrated and
included in the evolving identity and purpose that ultimately makes Integral
meaningful to us. This is the Source that serves us all. In this way, may we find
generative health in the emergence of Community as Master.

### Title:

PatternDynamics™: Creating Cultures of Sustainability

### Abstract:

This paper introduces PatternDynamics       (PD)- an Integral Sustainability

pattern language. PD is a tool for enactingcultures of sustainability through

communicating “Nature’s” design principles. We now have an abundance of

sustainability technologies and strategies relating to the “exterior” world—Lower-

Right quadrant. The next step in sustainability lies in facilitating a critical mass of

collective “interior” understanding and meaning—Lower-Left quadrant. Only by

making sustainability culturally meaningfulon a global basis will we enable the

level of diversified collaboration necessary for successfully scaling-up technical

and strategic solutions. Building and coordinating cultures of sustainability through

meaning-making, in all forms and at all levels of human organization is now a

key strategy. To develop meaning PD identifies a set of types from the enduring

dynamic patterns of organization found in natural systems and represents them as

diagrams— PD “patterns”— transforming them into principles of sustainability. As

principles they can be learned, communicated, combined and discussed, facilitating

mutual understanding and coordinated action. This article forms a foundation

introduction to PatternDynamics      as an Integral technology. It outlines PD as

a sustainability education initiative, its history, position within AQAL Integral

Theory,methodology,theory, contribution to Integral Pluralism, and how people may

become involved in its community of practice and work towards accreditation for

professional use.

Introduction

My purpose in writing this paper is to introducePatternDynamics™ (PD)—an Integral

Sustainability pattern language. I developed PD through my experiences in applying

Integral Theory in my work in sustainable design and during a ten-year experiment

in sustainable living and education. That experiment, undertaken on behalf of

Permaforest Trust, was the creation, participation in and management of a residential

sustainability education centre in the humid sub tropics of eastern Australia—what

we often referred to as an “educational community for sustainability.”In recounting

the story of this experiment, my work in sustainability,and the development of PD, I

hope to make it meaningful to you, so asto create a “culture”where you and I become

a “we”; and where we,in forming a whole from our parts in this way, gain a radical

new capacity to collaborate in facilitating sustainability. This approach is the essence

of PD: a language that communicates meaning in ways that enact and coordinate

cultures, enablingwider, more comprehensive collaborations in sustainability.

This is one of the core propositions of PD: that all of our technologies, all of our

design strategies, all of our economic initiatives—all of the focus in sustainability on

the Lower-Right quadrant—will not be effective unless they are supported by cultures

of sustainability— cultures generated through a focus on the Lower-Left quadrant.

An Integral perspective makes it clear that planetary sustainability must be supported

bymultiple cultures and divergent worldviews. What is the status of sustainability

among different cultures? How have cultures of sustainability been formed? Are they

inclusive enough? Is there cultural indifference or opposition to sustainability? If the

21st century is to be characterized by the challenges of sustaining collective human

health and development within the limits of the biosphere, are we maximizing our

efforts? Do we have the capacity to generate and integrate cultures of sustainability on

a global basis? If not, what are the Integral strategies and tools that will help us most?

Another core proposition of PD is that “types”, as an element in Integral Theory, have
unique properties that make them especially well suited to enacting and coordinating

cultures of sustainability. We can think of types, in this instance, as recurrent and

enduring general patterns of organization, or what I refer to as dynamic patterns. PD

introduces the perspective thattypesof organization that have endured for hundreds

of millions of years in physical and natural systems—what could be thought of as

Nature’s deep dynamic patterns of design—may be transformed into principles of

sustainability. In fact the deepest of these “Kosmic habits” can be thought of as meta-

types, an idea that I will develop into a theory in the conclusion.

PD works in sustainability through a set of “pattern” diagrams—the

PatternDynamics™ chart (See Appendix 1)— where each of the “pattern” symbols

signifies a principle of sustainability. The unique contribution of PD is not that it

can communicate principles of sustainability, nor that it can facilitate cultures of

sustainability through this process—I think there are a multitude of ways of doing

this already in existence. The unique offering of PD is its proposed capacity for

supporting the collaborative enactment of sustainabilityat all levels and locations

across the depth and span of society, and in so doing contribute, through an

Integral practice, to the requirement for a trulyplanetary culture of sustainability.

From an Integral perspective sustainability takes on new meaning, or rather it

integrates previous meanings and transcends them to emerge as wider and deeper sets

of perspectives on what it is to endure as a species. PD patterns act as an interface

bridging the world of dynamically organized objective relations called nature (LR)

with the world of dynamically organizedsubjective relations termed culture (LL). The

integrating power of a “language of patterns” imparts wider meaning—sustainability

at any level becomes a semiotic process integrating principles of “culture” andpatterns

of “nature”. Languaging through patterns brings forth an inherent awareness at

work in our world: a living presence of communication, relationship, memory,

intention and dynamic order built into the very fabric of the Kosmos. Enacting
this perspective stories a Kosmology capable of coordinating planetary action. As

members of a deeply sentient and self-ordering Kosmos we have the capacity to

collectively bringing forth its patterns and principles—however it is we understand

them—to facilitate the design of an enduring and evolving planetary society.

I will speculate here that some of the most powerful technologies of the 21st century

will not be in the production of things, the transformation of energy sources or the

development of information architectures. The most powerful technologies of the

21st century may well be those capable of integrating the widest sets of perspectives.

To explain why I think of PatternDynamics™, first and foremost,as an Integral

technology, and why I think of it as an attempt at a technology of this ilk, will take

up the rest of this paper. It starts with the story of the development of PD itself.

Permaculture

My main vehicle for working as a designer of sustainable systems—mostly in

forestry, agriculture, and human settlement—and as a sustainability educator has been

permaculture. Permaculture is a postmodern sustainability discipline, and true to its

postmodern orientation,it has many applications, and it may be viewed from many

different perspectives. It is often described as a system of sustainable human

settlement design. The word “permaculture” was originally a contraction of the

words “permanent” and“agriculture”: agriculture being the most fundamental aspect

of society that must be made enduring if we are to sustain human populations.

(Mollison and Holmgren 1978) With its origins in the design of sustainable

agricultural systems, it is often mistakenly thought of as only a form of

organic“garden agriculture.” Permaculture evolved rapidly beyond its origins in

agriculture to encompass the complete design of human settlements, where it came to

be thought of as a contraction of “permanent” and “culture”. Co-founder Bill

Mollison’s(1998) publication Permaculture: A Designer’s Manual made this move
explicit. More recently, with the publication of the other co-founder David

Holmgren’s (2002) latest book, Permaculture Principles and Pathways Beyond

Sustainability, it has shifted again to encompass the notion of permaculture design as

a way of applying general principles of sustainability, derived from nature, to virtually

all aspects of the economy and society.

After working and experimenting with permaculture for over 15 years now, I

tend to think of it differently again. For me permaculture is one of a number of

postmodern design approachesthat has looked to the systemsof nature as a method

of locating the principles for designing human systems. Permaculture also has a

three-fold set of ethics embedded deeply within its foundations: “care of earth,

care of people, and dispersal of surplus time, money, and materials towards those

ends.”(Mollison and Slay 1991) In my observation, it is the meaning of the ethics

and principles that creates the bonding power forming the culture of permaculture.

The cultural bonding power of meaning(LL), more than any other factor,has allowed

permaculture’s rapid global spread, to the point where it has become one of the most

influentialinitiatives in applied ecology. The nascent understanding that there is a

powerful relationship between nature and culture at the heart of sustainability and

that this may be illuminated through the relationship between ecologicalpatterns and

cultural principles is for me, now,the most important aspect of what I have learned

from practicing permaculture.

Permaculture was my portal to environmental awareness. Before encountering it I

had worked for 3 summers in Canada as a tree planter to pay off my university debts.

This was the start of my now 20 yearlong career in what I like to think of as the more

sustainable end of forestry practice. Living in the bush and working daily in the cut

blocks gave me an awareness of environmental issues, but it wasn’t until I moved to

Australia and did a 10 day foundation course in permaculture design that I became

fully committed to working in sustainability. Bill Mollison himself taught that course.
Through a process of story telling, vision, ecological understanding, humor, anger,

genius and outright charisma, I became powerfully sensitized to the meaning of

ecological sustainability; and through that process, I became fully indoctrinated into

the permaculture worldview.

In 1998, after training for a little less than two years at Mollison’s Permaculture

Institute at Tyalgum in northern New South Wales,I initiated a permaculture

project of my own—essentially to trial and test permaculture theory by putting it

into practice. I founded Permaforest Trust, a not-for-profit sustainability education

organization, and set out to establish a rural, permaculture training centre, also in

northern New South Wales. By this time I was working as a forestry and silviculture

contractor, andI directed surplus finances from this business to provide funds for the

project.

From Sensitivity to Integration

Looking back, my journey in permaculture has been the shift from sensitivity

to integration. When I entered the world of permaculture, I entered through the

emergence of a deep sensitivity to the plight of the planet and its role in sustaining

human society. In hindsight and with the benefit of an Integral perspective, I

recognize this as a hallmark of entering a green altitude of consciousness. This

article is writtenfor readers versed in Integral Theory, and therefore I won’t describe

the elements of an Integral approach necessary for interpreting parts of this article:

including,quadrants, levels (altitude), lines, states, and types. Readers interested in

explanations of these elements and for an introduction to Integral Post-Metaphysics—

also essential for interpreting parts of this article—should consult Ken Wilber’s

(2006) book Integral Spirituality.

The roughly ten-year period that I directed the sustainability centre on behalf of

Permaforest Trust (while also working as a permaculture designer and forestry
contractor) consisted of the slow and often difficult process of transcending the

limitations of my green sensitivity to a more Integral orientation. Permaforest

Trust, as the sustainability education centre become known, was an attempt to

create a temporary community of permaculture students, facilitators, staff, guests

and volunteers demonstrating environmentally sustainable ways of living. The

centre, established on a vacant rural property, grew slowly from a handful of

participants in the early days to an average daily population of 20-25 people. We

built infrastructure and developed residential Certificate 4 and Diploma programs

in Accredited Permaculture Training. The centre was designed as a living example

of sustainability where students could reside temporarily in a small permaculture

community and participate daily in growing, storingand preparing their own food,

operating alternative energy systems, harvesting water, integrating their wastes

back into the environment and restoring the landscape. We did manage to live in a

way that dramatically reduced the environmental footprints of the participants, but

ironically, and in the final analysis, permaculture interpreted through a primarily

green worldview was not sustainable.

The principal reason it was not sustainable (we concluded the project in 2008) was

not because our permaculture strategies for designing productive food, primary

commodityand energy systems were not viable and ecologically sound. Our earth

care—Lower-Right quadrant—strategies worked quite well. The challenges were

primarily cultural—Lower-Left quadrant—dynamics. We started with a deeply

and almost exclusively green culture. Initially, being primarily oriented in green

myself, I could not make this distinction, but the limitations of a limited perspective,

so to speak, became clear soon enough. I’ve written about this dynamic and how

an Integral perspective helped in overcoming these challenges at length in two

previous works (Winton 2005, Winton 2010). Here I will only recount the key

components for illuminating the meaning and development of PatternDynamics™.
What became obvious very quickly was that a postmodern, green orientation was

not receptive to useful aspects of other altitudes. Very generally and in brief, we

suffered from a lack of orange altitude economic and productive capacity and

amber altitude social structure. This was crippling. The realities of living on the

land actually demand a high level of manual labor, and the center itself required

a healthy income to operate. Productive manual labor and economic performance

were not highly regarded—in fact they were often discouraged. In general, our

participants prioritizedinterpersonal dialogue and process, emotional healing,

personal development and recreation—life choices that, as a rule, took priority

over personal and economic performance. Also, sharing energy and resources to

lower our environmental impact required high levels of community commitment

and coordination. Despite a general ethos of “community” among our participants,

sacrificing personal freedom and lifestyle choices in order to conform to our

community structures proved challenging.

In my professional life as a contractor and designer, I often had the opposite

experience: instead of being embedded in an exclusive worldview, I was confronted

with multiple worldviews. On one particularly memorable reforestation project, as the

forestry and silvicultural contractor, I was engaged as the only person with a green

orientation; my client was a large (orange) investment business, represented on site

by their operations manager; the landowner was a traditional (amber) farmer; and

the people I engaged to plant the trees were all from a local aboriginal community

(magenta/amber). In this instance multiple worldviews were present in a project with

a sustainability orientation (provision of renewable resources), but they were poorly

integrated. While the job got done, it was not done in a way that could be sustained.

There was a clear and palpable rejection of the fundamental ways-of-being-in-the-

world of each worldview by the others.

What became very clear to me from these experiences was that while both
Permaforest Trust and the plantation forestry projects were based on potentially

viable “sustainable” alternatives, neither could be sustained. It wasn’t their Lower-

Right quadrant activities, in-and-of-themselves, that were unsustainable—both could

have technically persisted in producing essential commodities without undermining

the health of the biosphere. They were unsustainable because culturally—in the

Lower-Left quadrant—they were not balanced and integrated. In the case of

Permaforest Trust’s education centre, it was mainly because the management

demands of integrating the green culture of the participants into a project that

required other cultural values and capacities, could not sustain managers–inevitably

management burnt out trying. In the case of the plantation forestry projects they

suffered from a lack of cultural balance:their business models (which have, for the

most part, now failed) were based on cultures of extreme profit taking. Also, they

needlessly antagonized traditional farming cultures in the localities where they

established the plantations, which weakened their political support.

I found myself becoming acutely aware of the importance of balancing and

integrating cultural perspectives in facilitating sustainability. Ken Wilber’s

(1995) Integral framework, first encountered in his book, Sex Ecology and

Spirituality, was invaluable in helping metranscend my green perspective and in

making sense of my situation. I realized that exclusive perspectives, like green

environmentalism, could no more reject orange industry or amber social structures

any more than I could reject my lungs or my bones and hope to sustain my body.

Correlatively, multiple worldviews could notremain fractured and unbalanced either.

I noticed that each altitude, in fact, had its own interpretation of sustainability:

for magenta it was sustaining ancestral connection to “country”; for amber it was

sustaining community structure; for orange it was sustaining productivity; and for

green it was sustaining nature. It became clear that all altitudes contributed essential

aspects of sustainability. For me, from an Integral perspective, it also became obvious
that if Lower-Right quadrant technical and strategic approaches depended on cultural

support, then an Integral approach had to include finding ways to coordinate the

cultures of sustainability across the depth and span of society.

Types

Having developed an Integral orientation, I found that my views on the validity

ofthings like healthyorange and amber values within sustainability were seen by my

green peers and students as somewhat—to say the least—unconventional. Without

realizing it at first, I developed a strategy of relying on types as an aspect of Integral

Theory to help me explain my new perspectives. Because types can be seen as general

patterns of organization, or in Integral terms as “horizontal styles available to any

developmental level within the quadrants” (Rentschler, 2006, p.35), they became a

useful way of explaining an important aspect of sustainability contributed by one

altitude to someone in another. They gave me a means of focusing on a system’s

dynamic patterns (types) as an aspect of sustainability rather than its location

(quadrant + level). It was very helpful to focus on types of systems patterns that could

be “languaged” to fit the altitude I was speaking to, as opposed to focusing on the

level of culture (altitude) it was perceived to originate in, which was often rejected out

of hand.

It is the horizontal aspect of types and their role in structuring the span of the

Kosmos that makes them useful in this regard. I will develop this idea further in

concluding this paper and after an explanation of the development of PD. Space does

not permit a further exploration of the other qualities of types in Integral Theory

here—we will cover only the essential aspects relative to PD. Also, we will not

cover the potential pitfall of engaging in this strategy, except to note, as per Rodger

Walsh’s (2008) presentation at the first Integral Theory Conference, that they are

real and that they must be considered. I have written previously in depth about
the properties of types, their usefulness in this capacity, and their development as

pattern languagesin an article (Winton 2010) for the Journal of Integral Theory

and Practice entitled: “Developing an Integral Sustainability Pattern Language”.

At first when I used this strategy it was almost always me, at an Integral

altitude, “languaging” an important contribution to sustainability from amber or

orange altitude to someone at a green altitude. For instance I would pick a type

(pattern) of organization critical for sustaining an ecosystem that was helpful in

supporting my inclusion of an amber or orange perspective. In this case, lets say I

chose to use the pattern of theflow(an actual pattern from the PD chart) of energy

through an ecosystem. Then, for instance at Permaforest Trust (green), I explained

that the need for economic performance (orange) was necessary to maintain a

nurturing flow of resources into our community system; so that we could sustain our

training program; so that graduates could contribute to creating a sustainable world.

Later I realized that this general approach allowed me to integrate perspectives not

only from orange to green, butfromany altitude to any altitude—providing I could

find a pattern (type) to facilitate the translation. I also had some success in teaching

people oriented at various altitudes to use the patterns in a similar way. Eventually,

I collected about 50 or so of these natural patterns, mostly through observations

of ecosystem dynamics and through studies in systems disciplines. I found myself

usingthis set of types—what I thought ofas a Lower-Right typology—over and over

again as reliable translators.

PatternDynamics™

After a time, I started to formalize this method by cataloguing the types of systems

patterns that worked most effectively. Then I created a “pattern diagram”, known as

a “pattern” to represent the corresponding principle at work in sustaining a system.

Just to clarify, when I’m talking about the structural pattern of the actual Lower-
Right system itself (referent), I refer to it as a dynamic pattern, natural pattern or

pattern of organization; when I’m talking about the pattern diagram (signifier), I

refer to it as a pattern; and when I’m talking about the meaning (signified) enacted

by the pattern, I refer to it as aprinciple. This takes us back to the patterns and

principles of sustainability used in permaculture. The addition here is the creation

of asemiotic process(pattern language) via a symbolic “pattern” diagram that

explicitly connects a dynamic pattern of Lower-Right systemsfunction with a

principle of sustainability,enacting meaning necessary for the formation of cultures

of sustainability. As we will see, semiotics and enactment play central roles in the

methodology and in developing the underpinning theory of PD.

The next step in creating PD was to assemble my set of patterns, like flow used in

the example above, into groups based on general similarity. I chose 49, which I

called second-tier patterns, and sorted theminto seven like groups called Rhythm,

Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity, Dynamics and Source, which I called first-

tier patterns. I saw the second-tier patterns in each group as aspects(perspectives)

of their respective first-tier patterns. For instance, flow is one of seven aspects, or

different perspectives one could take, of the pattern Exchange. In the chart, the seven

second-tier patterns related to each first-tier pattern, form a column under that first-

tier pattern. The color-coding(shading if printed in mono) on the PD chart (See

Appendix 1) also makes it clear which column of second-tier patterns are aspects

of which first-tier patterns. Lastly, I realized that the six first-tier patterns (Rhythm,

Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity and Dynamics) where aspects (perspectives)

of Source. Source, then,is the deepest most general pattern of them all. If the first-

tier patters were, in effect, meta-patterns of the second-tier patterns, then Source,

as a meta-pattern to the first-tier patterns, is a meta-meta-pattern of the second-tier

patterns. Source, as a primordial meta-pattern or meta-type, could be seen as the most

fundamental organizing principle of the Kosmos—simply that holons (subject/object/
part/wholes) self-organize and evolve.

With some minor adjustments and some minor revision the second-tier patterns laid

out structurally into a matrix chart created by the first-tier patterns (See Appendix

1). That is, each second-tier pattern appears to be made up of the qualities of the

two first tier-patterns that intersect at that location on the matrix. This, along with

its name and the nature of the pattern diagram itself, give the userindicators as to the

meaning of that particular pattern. As an example, the second-tier pattern, swing, lies

at the intersection of Rhythm and Polarity, indicating, along with the diagram and its

name, that swing signifies the principle that all systems, in sustaining their function,

will attempt to iterate (swing) between opposite states over time. Flow, as another

example, is the intersection of Exchange and Source, indicating that flow is the most

fundamental aspect of any exchange dynamic in a system- no flow, no exchange.

That, in summary, is how the core intellectual property of PatternDynamics™, an

Integral technology, was created.

Organizing the patterns in this fashion made it obvious that the ones that worked

most effectively were actually meta-patterns or meta-types, and that it was their

presence as deep systems organizing patterns that made them recognizable by people

at any altitude. Each altitude had its own specific ways of “seeing” these ancient

and ever present dynamic patterns just as each altitude had its own unique ways

of “seeing” sustainability. The critical point here, from the perspective of meta-

types, is that although they are interpreted in unique ways at unique altitudes, meta-

types may be signified such that they enact meta-meaning.Meta-meaning that has the

power to assemble unique, but partial, perspectives into wider, integrated wholes.

The deeper and more encompassing the meta-type is, the wider the meta-meaning,

the wider the culture, the wider the collaboration. I see the research of identifying

the interpretations of meta-types at various altitudes and how these have evolved

and are evolving as a crucial part of the work that should be undertaken by aPD
community of practice. The idea of meta-types, their integrating function and their

use in enacting large-scale collaboration will be developed as a theory of meta-types

in the concluding section of this paper.

Methodology

Learning PD is relatively simple. One discusses the patterns with others in an

attempt to spot them in different kinds of systems, and in this way—through

communicating nature’s design principles—learn their meaning. At one level this

may be thought of as basic training in “systems thinking”, designed to be adaptable

across organizations in all domains and at all levels.This is the application of PD as an

Integral Sustainability education initiative. The methodology of PD is also simple and

it has two main applications: one for bringing sustainability to existing systems and

on for the sustainable design of new systems. In the first application, once the user

learns to spot the patterns, they then identify the ones that are dysfunctional in a given

system. The symptoms indicating this are usually at some point obvious. For instance,

in the system of your body, if the flow of blood is impeded in your arteries, there will

be a range of symptoms signaling this problem as the condition worsens. The same

would be true if the cash flow in a business was impeded, or the flow of resources was

restricted to and industry. The interesting and important aspect of the PD method is

that, if you are otherwise reasonably healthy, we probably don’t need to worry about

the other patterns—they are balanced and integrated and therefore they are healthy

and enduring. Once dysfunctional patterns are identified, an attempt is made to

balance them where they are unbalanced and to integrate them into the system where

they are absent. In this instance, you might undertake practices to increase (balance)

the low flow of blood in your arteries, perhaps by revising your diet or exercising

or taking medication. Undertaking these injunctions should make your body more

enduring or “sustainable”.
The second application of the methodology is to discussions, negotiations and

collaborations about the design of human systems, from cities, to industries,

agricultures, financial systems and organizations—in fact, any LR system. A

proposed design may be checked by all of the stakeholders by scanning and

evaluating its potential effects;then each stakeholder may argue the merits of their

perspectives based on balancing and integrating the design for the health of the whole

of biosphere and society. In this instance PD has the potential to directlyfacilitate

mass collaboration as a design process in sustainability. Instead of cultural

fragmentation in sustainability, PD provides a way to bring divergent perspectives

to the table and to argue their merits based on a common language. This does not

guarantee that everyone will have their perspective included, but it does ensure

that they can be heard. PD, in this sense, is about facilitating more comprehensive

conversations. I think this is a big step up from the situation we find ourselves in

now, where cultures are fractured over the issue of sustainability and therefore mass

collaboration, at the required scales, is not yet a reality.

With reference to the AQAL framework,we are identifying deep patterns of

organization (meta-types) from “systems” enacted through the Lower-Right

quadrant—ecosystems, economic systems: in fact any system, of any kind, at any

level enacted with a Zone 8 methodology.I believe it is actually possible to identify

these meta-typesin the structures of any of the evenly numbered Zones at any level—

in this case I refer to them as “Nature’s” design principles or “Kosmic habits”— but,

for general use, it is clearer and simpler if we locate them in readily observable Lower

Right “natural” systems, like ecosystems and social systems.

The application of PD methodology for engendering enduring health (sustainability)

in the Lower Right (in any system), at any level, is simply to scan, evaluate, balance

and integrate. In that way, PD could be thought of, in part, as a kind of Traditional

Chinese Medicine approach to sustainability—find the pathology, evaluate its cause,
then balance and integrate the system for health. In this way it may also be used

as a guide to the design of sustainable systems. PD claims that it is working with a

method that is able to do these things in the context of sustainability (the enduring

health of humanity)—at any scale. The capacity of PD for engendering systemic

health may be recognizableat smaller scales—like in a community or a business—

but at larger scales, and particularly in the Lower-Left quadrant where it becomes part

of culture itself, the mechanisms will be less obvious. If this is the case, then, these

mechanisms—as with the effects of other Integral methodologies—will either be

denied or seen as a sort of magic.

In summary, from an Integral perspective, PD works primarily at the human level

of development with the dynamics between two quadrants (LR and LL) and a set

of meta-types (PD) to facilitate mass collaboration in the design and creation of a

sustainable world.In this way the effectiveness of PD is based on the theory that

meta-types generate meta-principles that generate meta-cultures that generate meta-

collaboration for assisting in the integrated collaborative design of a planetary society.

A Theory of Meta-Types

Or, rather, that is my assertion. I will conclude this paper with an attempt to reconcile

a theory of meta-types with the specification in Integral Post Meta-Physics that “the

meaning of a statement is the injunction of its enactment.” (Wilber 2006, p.268)

Firstly, meta-types as Integral objects (ontology), can only be fully recognized

through Turquoise cognition (epistemology) or higher. Secondly, we must specify

the injunctions (methodology) required for the enactment of the mechanisms

underpinning such a theory. In order to do that we will need to include elements of the

historical works of philosopher Charles Saunders Peirce and aspects of the latest work

byIntegral Theorist Sean Esbjörn-Hargens.

Semiotic Enactment
I propose that the nature of the mechanism underpinning a theory of meta-types,

is essentially semiotic: where semiotic denotes an ongoing “action inquiry”,

a “signalling” between holons—a sign processof communication, at any level,that

allows for the relational enactment of parts by parts so as to form wholes.We may

signify semioticenactment as the ongoing act of “bringing-into-relationship-so-as-

to-bring-into-being”. No signalling, no relationship, no enactment, no wholes (no

holons/social holons). Semiotic enactment relies not only on the perspectives of parts

and wholes, but also on the subjectivity of objects. Signs and signalling (semiotic)

relate to the subjective aspects of holons. As perC.S. Peirce’s (1958) concept of

semiotic, a sign relationis triadic in nature and must include a “representamen”

(signifier), an “object” (referent) and an “interpretant”(that which enacts a signified)

—a mind-like quality (sentient capacity available at all levels of being) capable of

subjectively “interpreting” a signal, so as to “enact” a relationship,so as to form

a whole. This quality of “interpretation” in semiotic enactment, with regard to

the perspectives I’m illuminating here, should, even at the most basic levels of

matter, also include other aspects of sentience, including intentionality, memory,

discrimination (the ability to make distinctions) and teleology (the ability to impart

direction on material processes).

Semiotic enactment must also include the perspective that it is an iterative process.

As well as being essentially enactive, semiotic is also inherently dynamic—

it is an iterative process facilitatingpatterns of dynamic organization. Semiotic

enactment signifiesthe moment-to-moment dynamically evolving embodiment

brought forth through an Integral perspective. AsPeirce (1958) has pointed out,

each interpretant “determines” a new representamen (signifier) that goes on to be

interpreted (signified) forming a further representamen (signifier) which goes on

to be interpreted (signified) in a cascading developmental(evolving) process of the

bringing-into-being(of the object/holon) through bringing-into-communicative-
relationship of its signalling parts. Semiotic enactment, as the process of evolving

integrative patterns of communication bringing forth holons,may look different in

each of the domains of matter (geosemiotics), body (biosemiotics), mind (semiotics)

and spirit (theosemiotics) but the patternis the same—I will signify the common

pattern of semiotic enactment underlying each of these levels as Kosmosemiosis.

Another way of looking at all this is that the universe is composed of sentient

beings at all levels— from atoms to molecules to cells, to… all the way up

and all the way down. All of which are holons (subject/object/part/wholes) in

multitudes of semiotic enactive relationships of varying degrees of intensity with

other holons in an unimaginably complex, overlapping, inter-enacting, pattern

oriented, evolving meshwork’s of meshwork’s we call the Kosmos. If that is the

case, then we may consider any holon as constituting a distributed primordial

organizational “intelligence” that participates inevolutionary semiotic enactment,

creating more and more complex and concentrated sentient forms through time.

This “intelligence” is carried and signalled at all levels of enactment. This approach

explains why successful “patterns” of enactment are used again and again— they are

successful, so they are copied, and they are able to be copied because the dynamic

patterns of enactment (the forms of holons) are being continuously signalled in a vast

field of dynamic sentient embodiment. The older the patterns of semiotic, the more

deeply entrenched, stable and encompassing are their types of form: the deepest, most

encompassing, most stable patterns of semiotic enactment are what I am signifying

as meta-types. Evolutionary semiotic enactment, then, is the centralmechanism

underpinning a theory of meta-types.

Integral Pluralism

Sean Esbjörn-Hargens (2010) in a recent article for the Journal of Integral Theory and

Practice entitled “An Ontology of Climate Change” introduces Integral Pluralism and
Integral Enactment Theory. In his words: “Integral Pluralism specifically includes:

Integral Epistemological Pluralism (IEP), Integral Methodological Pluralism (IMP)

and Integral Ontological Pluralism (IOP). Integral Pluralism forms the basis for what

I am calling Integral Enactment Theory.” (Esbjorn-Hargens, 2010, p. 146) Integral

Enactment Theory brings forth the requirement in Integral Post-Metaphysics for

specifying the triadic relationship of subject-method-object (epistemology-

methodology-ontology) in enactment—where enactment is a claim that something

exists. Integral Enactment Theory is represented in Figure 1.

       Figure 1   Integral Enactment Theory (from Esbjörn-Hargens 2010)

Notice how the arrows in Figure 1 representing multiple methodologies point both

ways, indicating a “double hermeneutic”. A double hermeneutic signifies that not only

do subjects enact objects, but that objects may change as a result of that activity. In

that case objects must not be only objects, they must also have a subjective aspect if

they are “aware” of being enacted and then change as a result. If this is true, and if it

is true that any “thing” enacted is a holon with subjective and objective (as well as

part and whole) dimensions then which holon is the subject and which is the object is

a matter of the perspective one takes on the direction of the hermeneutic. Who is

interpreting who, or indeed, what is interpreting what, is a matter of the direction of

the enactment. Lets call this “enactive direction”.         From an AQAL Integral
perspective any enactment is a methodology (injunction) between one holon(subject/

object/part/whole) and another holon (subject/object/part/whole). From here it is a

short step to move from the triadic relation of Esbjörn-Hargen’s Integral

EnactmentTheory to the triadic relation of Peirce’s Semiotic Theory. I propose that

Integral enactment has a strong semiotic dimension—that, in fact, Integral enactment

is, with a small shift in perspective, Semiotic enactment. I will illustrate this point

with a series of diagrams, but before we look to them, I will introduce one more

concept necessary to complete an outline of a theory of meta-types.

Kosmic Positioning System

I’m championing types generally and meta-types in particular because I think that

they are key, under enacted elements in Integral Theory, and that through a fuller

illumination we may move to compliment AQAL Location with AQAL Enactment.In

the concluding section of his article, Esbjörn-Hargens (2010, p.164) proposes a

Kosmic positioning system, which is subtly different to Kosmic address. An address

implies a static placement. A positioning system implies a way, not only to locate

position, but to track dynamic patterns of unfolding from that position. In this way

holons may be trackedwithin the AQAL world-space through “location” (depth) and

through “enactive meta-type” or “dynamic pattern”(span)—address and enactment. A

useful analogy here is that of position and trajectory within a Cartesian world-space.

Having only the position of an object within an x and y coordinate system is fine,

but it is greatly complimented and much more useful if its trajectory is also known.

From a slightly different perspective, this approach could also be seen as emphasizing

the practice of bringing healththrough meta-types (a focus on span) as consort to

the practice of recognizing evolution through location (a focus on depth) in Integral

Theory and Practice. I will end with a series of diagrams and a short conclusion

enacting meta-types as compliments to the primordial perspectives signified by the

AQAL quadrants.
Figure 2 illustrates “Integral Enactment” in a simplified version of Esbjörn-

Hargensdiagram in Figure 1, which shows a more comprehensive diagram

of “Integral Enactment Theory”.

Figure 2    Diagram showing “double hermeneutic” in Integral Enactment

Figure 3 below shows how we move from Integral enactment to semiotic enactment.

It indicates an iterative quality with multiple tracings of lines representing the

ongoing and evolving semiotic process between parts that enacts those parts as a

whole. Notice how the double hermeneutic of Figure 2 becomes the semiotic “point”

illustrated in Figure 3. Also, note how the subject and object shapes in Figure 2 both

become “subject/objects”embedded in the joined rounded shapes of the infinity type

symbol of Figure 3. Interestingly, the diagram in figure 3 also looks like a simplified

version of some phase space diagrams used to demonstrate the nature of attractorsin

Chaos Theory.
Figure 3   Diagram illustrating Semiotic Enactment

By drawing an encompassing oval around the “parts” shown in Figure 3, Figure 4

below illustrates meta-types as enacted patterns of semiotic process. I think of this,

in its most primordial form, as signifying the original meta-type or dynamic pattern

of the Kosmos. I call it “Source”. Source is simply the meta-pattern representing the

fact that everything in the Kosmos exhibits part/whole/subject/object perspectives and

semiotic/enactment processes. Another way of saying this is that the first and deepest

organizing principle at work in the Kosmos is that the Kosmos self-organizes and

evolves.

       Figure 4    Diagram showing primordial Meta-Type “Source”

Figure 5 shows how types may be represented within an AQAL quadrant diagram

as a way of illustrating a particular horizontal systems dynamic or set of dynamic

patterns at a vertically specified location or locations. This diagram also shows a

representation of meta-types (e.g., more widely manifested types like masculine/

feminine) and Source, the primary meta-type, and its relationship to the primordial

perspectives of the AQAL quadrants. What this diagram helps illustrate is that

the quadrants themselves represent a meta-type, a dynamic pattern of enactment

originating where the perspectives intersect at the centre of the cross. The

semiotic “point” of the Source diagram overlaid with the quadrant intersection

point, or “integration point” indicates that they are two different but overlapping
ways of signifying original/primordial patterns/perspectives: both diagrams include

subject/object/part/wholes and a signification of enactive development. One focuses

on “forming” vertical depth (creative advance) and the other on “formed” horizontal

span (dynamic patterns). We now have representations of two overlapping Integral

objects- one enacted from a focus on “horizontal” perspectives and one from a focus

on “vertical” perspectives.

Figure 5 also illustrates the relationship of types to meta-types. Types are more

specific dynamic patters that we identify at a location. The popular Myer-Briggs types

are a good example. These are types of personality located in known lines and levels

of the Upper-Left quadrant. Meta-types, like masculine/feminine are more general and

may be applied at wider locations. The primary meta-type, Source, is the most general

and most widely observed organizing principle: that principle being simply that the

universe has a deeply ingrained habit—evolutionary semiotic enactment.

Figure 5     AQAL Diagram showing quadrants, levels, lines, states, types, meta-types

and Source

Figure 6, entitled Integral Kosmosemiosis, signifies a primordial integrated

perspectival/semiotic dimension of the Kosmos. It is an integrated form of Source.

As a primordial meta-type we can work with it using the same method we use to

work with PD patterns: learn to recognize, evaluate, and balance and integrate it in
service of enduring health and ongoing evolution. By learning PD patterns, or any

other system of meta-types, we learn to see, balance and integrate the dynamics of

Source—in all its aspects—without having to work out the complexity of its vast

evolutionary inter-enmeshed dynamics. Sustainability then becomes the process of

relaxing and trusting in the evolutionary intelligence of the Kosmos, to play in the

enactment ofKosmosemiosis such that we dance with it rather than fight against it.

               Figure 6   Symbol of Integral Kosmosemiosis

Semiotic enactment is the injunction required to bring forth, from a Turquoise

perspective or higher, the Integral object, Meta-types.

In part, what I am trying to do here is to encourage a move to a more span based,

horizontally focused, dynamically oriented, ontological embodiment concerned

approach, focused on enduring health—what I would characterize as a more

feminine approach in Integral Theory and Practice—to compliment the yet-

to-be-balanced more masculine focus on thedepth based, vertically focused,

address oriented, epistemological knowingconcerned, focus onevolutionarily

progressionenacted to date in Integral Theory and Practice. This discussion is in

service of more fully enacting Integral Theory as a dance in our radiant embodiment

as well as a dive into our conscious depth. A little Integral Eve for our Integral Adam.

The Meaning of Planetary Civilization: Integral Rational Spirituality and the

Semiotic Universe

### Abstract:

This paper composes a formal constellation of distinct, but overlapping,

philosophical, methodological, and theoretical commitments enactive within the

integrative world-space. This approach is proposed as a basis for exploring a

pragmatic meta-worldview capable of carrying meaning making necessary for the

formation of a healthy and enduring Planetary Civilization. The heart of this challenge

lies in finding a coherent and culturally extensible contemporary integration of

humanity’s most persistent and foundational dualism–that of materialist and

spiritualist views (with their respective ontic/realist v espistemic/idealist orientations)

and the over-arching meaning making cosmologies they respectively support. I

contend that current integrative approaches are still early in the developmental

process of forming such a view, and that while they move us ever closer to a viable

nondual orientation, they are ultimately perceived to fall on one side or the other of

the divide and therefor fail, as yet, to locate a meaningfully comprehensivist stance

capable of uniting all of humanity under one cosmological structure. In this paper I

seek to develop an integral pragmatasist approach, which I refer to as integral

Semiotic Realism, as a distinction supportive of resolving the cosmological divide. An

integral cosmology is then proposed based on the post-metaphysical injunction

prescribed by the semiotic enactment of Planetary Civilization through the

signification of Integral Rational Spirituality. This endeavor fits within and

contributes to the development of Integral Post-Metaphysics, Integral Pluralism and

an integrative Realism and strives to locate unity in their diversity.

Introduction

In this paper I put forward a case that the main priority of integral endeavors, at this

time, should be to work deeply within and to enable ‘modernity’, despite–and in fact

because of–its destructive tendencies, atrocities, and its industrial scale capacities for

undermining the ecological and social foundations of the planet we live on. That from

an integral perspective, to seek to transcend modernity before we have established a

healthier, horizontal manifestation of it, and before it has, in fact, reached a certain

stage of maturity, will make it impossible to include it as anything but a deep and

destructive shadow within an emerging Planetary Civilization. Furthermore, I contend

that in order to facilitate, not only the reduction of pathologies, but the enhancement

of actual (and, of course, already substantial) apithological, generative health (Varey,

2004) within modernity, it is necessary to introduce a source of ultimate meaning as a

foundation for strengthening appropriate ethical behavior within the modern milieu. I

propose that this can be undertaken via the generation of a viable nondual, integrative

planetary cosmology–one that will be acceptably interpreted as the origin of

reverence, deep meaning, and ultimate significance so as to provide a source of

underlying unity for the diverse perspectives of traditional, modern, post-modern and

integral worldviews. A nondual approach of this nature, however, may entail

modifying, within the integral context, the meaning of some of our deepest notions of

‘spirituality’ itself.

In laying out the supporting argument for an integrative planetary cosmology (the

terms ‘integral’ and ‘integrative’ will be used interchangeably in this paper) we will

explore and attempt to configure elements from somewhat diverse philosophical,

methodological and theoretical traditions. We start with an examination of current

discussions between, and the work of, two of the most prominent integrative meta-

theorists–Roy Bhaskar, with his philosophy of Critical Realism/metaRealism

(CR/MR) and Ken Wilber, with Integral Theory (IT). We work through the claimed

and counter claimed orientations to ontological foundationalism and epistemological

bias respectively. These assertions are examined in relation to: what it means to be

interpreted to fall (not necessarily wholly, but at the very least as a bias) on one side

or the other of what I refer to as the ‘cosmological divide’; and, why this matters. The

cosmological divide is here defined as the boundary region between worldviews that

are, however subtly, perceived (interpreted) to be orientated more to either an

epistemological view, where some sort of conscious sentience or ‘interiority’

pervades and is foundational to reality, or an ontological view, where ‘objects’ or

‘real things’ are foundational and underpin any forms of consciousness. Both Wilber

and Bhaskar claim a nondual stance. I argue that, while this may be true and

supportable within their own (substantial) frameworks, from a wider, pragmatic point

of view, neither as yet do. It may be a third, and lesser known (though only in the

English speaking world), figure–also considered an integrative meta-theorist–Edgar

Morin, with his orientation to Method as a process of inquiry within the discipline of

Complex Thought (CT)–and with it the possibility for constructing the meaning that

will allow us to sustain ‘homeland earth’–who provides the most fruitful direction in

which to look for a ‘way’ of resolving the cosmological divide.

       In the middle section the connection between method, inquiry, and meaning making

is extended and an argument is mounted that a semiotic approach will best serve as

the foundational logic of an integrative cosmology. Sean Esbjorn-Hargens’ (2010)

work on Integral Enactment Theory (IET) and my related idea that integral enactment

may be interpreted as semiotic in nature (semiotic enactment) are reviewed. Semiotic

Enactment (SE) is a concept I developed initially in relation to IET to support a theory

of meta-types, which in turn underpins the development of an integral sustainability

pattern language, PatternDynamics (PD). (Winton, 2010 a) PD may be embedded

within IT as a set of meta-types, and it also has a strong resonance with, as a

particular ‘complexity language’ framework, the more general notion of CT. SE is

then evolved to act as a bridge, and therefor a middle ground in its own right, that can

demonstrate the nonduality of epistemology and ontology within a semiotically

orientated cosmology-building context. Here we explore the idea of ‘semiotic depth’

to compliment the strength of Bhaskar’s categories of ontological depth and Wilber’s

development of epistemological depth. We go on to incorporate further aspects of

Charles Saunders Peirce’s sign theory into SE (which already borrows substantially

from his semiotic philosophy) to develop a distinct type of pansemiotism, signified as

integral Semiotic Realism (iSR). We investigate Stanley N. Salthe’s requirement, in

light of the discoveries of the complexity sciences, for the reintroduction of the last

two of Aristotle’s four types of causes–formal and final–in order to form a coherent

contemporary, scientifically grounded cosmology (Zimmerman, 2013). Rupert

Sheldrake’s work on formative causation via morphic resonance in morphic fields is

put forward as a basis for reinstating formal causes. A tradition of thinking about

energy quality (the so called 4th law of thermodynamics/energy), extending from

Odum to Lotka and back finally to Boltzmann, Clausius and Carnot, is substituted for

Salthe’s proposition that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics should account for final

causes.

In the concluding section I speculate on: the pragmatic implications of IRS v current

integrative approaches to spirituality; the nature of its more naturalistic orientations;

how IRS and its embeddedness within a Semiotic Realism may function as the basis

of an integrative nondual cosmology; why this is critical to the essential project of

fulfilling the promise of modernity; and, why that is of central importance to the

human project. Finally we look at what the preceding items might mean for those of

us identified with an integrative worldview in the development of Planetary

Civilization.

Modernity and Planetary Civilization

The notion of Planetary Civilization is here not synonymous with an integral or post-

postmodern society, in the sense of a society where the dominant majority of power,

influence and activity takes place from within an integral worldview. There is no

doubt, however, that for the first time there is evolving a human society global in

complexity, scope, scale, interconnectedness, environmental and social effects that

puts us firmly in the Planetary Era (Morin, 1999) (Stein, 2010): Planetary Civilization

is already upon us. And it is, I suggest, in the main, distinctly modern in character.

While it may be argued that some of the technologies leading the development of this

latest phase of modernity and the cognition behind them fits within an

integrative/post-formal emergence, it does not change the fact that their effects are at

this stage only to enhance the activities of an unprecedentedly powerful modern

world. And with billions of people all over the planet unrelentingly taking up the

opportunities afforded by modernization, the development of this Planetary phase of

modernization has really only just begun. What effects self-consciously integrative

communities of practice are having on this development currently, or may scale to

have going forward, is difficult to determine. Only relatively small numbers are

projected to enter post-formal orientations in the near future. To gain any real traction

integrative initiatives will have to be strategic, targeted, and find highly leveraged

approaches that are meaningful enough to act at scale in order to have significant

effects within the globally dominant dynamics of modernity.

We will use Bhaskar’s (and Habermas’s) (2007) convention and refer to the

distinction between modernity and post-modernity as one akin more to degree than of

kind. Bhaskar (2002) sees postmodernism as an element of the larger “philosophical

discourse of modernity.” (PDM) Going forward, the use of the term ‘modernity’ or

‘modern’ will refer to both modernity and post-modernity, as they are more generally

recognized, as well as Bhaskar’s distinction regarding ‘modernisation’. Bhaskar’s last

phase of the PDM, Western (Bourgeois) Triumphalism is replaced with a distinction

signified by the term Planetary Civilization. While it is important to understand the

differences between the various phases of modernity, particularly between what

Bhaskar refers to as high modernity and so called post-modernity, the grouping put

forward here is important for the position stated in this paper. It is also consistent with

Wilber’s (1995) critique of both modernity and post-modernity as ‘flatland’

worldviews. Flatland being the term for signifying his critique of the lack of

recognition of depth or ‘interiority’ as a foundational aspect of reality by both

modernity and post-modernity, and that it is only at a collectively integral and

individually post-formal level where a major transition begins that integrates both

‘interior’ and ‘exterior’ realities in a nondual orientation.

This view of modernity also reinforces the fact that sustaining the activities of the

(economically) developing world (modernization), and the existing economic

throughput of those nations already having industrialized (modern/post-modern), is

humanities greatest challenge. This challenge can be met by finding ways to make

sustaining human society and the planet we live on more meaningful and therefore

more visible within modernity. A key component of this strategy is the requirement

for forging a new source of ‘ultimate meaning’ as a basis for ethical guidance.

Ultimate meaning of this sort, and any deep rational for revering the cosmos (and by

extension our own world), has been largely absent from modernity since it rejected

the guiding spirituality of more traditional historic societies. The spiritual

consciousness of traditional periods that supported the overarching ethical programs

of those times, such as they were, were replaced in modernity by a cold materialist

turn. Human consciousness was now relegated to but an epiphenomenon of material

processes in a meaningless and purposeless universe. The destructiveness of

modernity is surely linked to this ‘cosmology of meaninglessness’. It is like a great

gaping bottomless existential hole that we try and fill with the only things that can

signify high levels of meaning within a materialist cosmology–material artifacts. A

form of spirituality readily acceptable within modernity could conceivably remedy

this, but it would need to meet the requirement by modernity for being situated within

a cosmology that is rationality explicable. In this regard the voice of modernity will

have to be respected, not just because it looks like (within this view) it has to be, but

because no spirituality can claim to be truly integral unless it does.

The Meaning of Meta-theories

It is because of their power to influence the articulation of modernity–that is, the more

horizontal development of its type, health, and maturity, and its effect on the

emergence of Planetary Civilization–that the debates regarding the philosophical

positions of integrative meta-theories matter. To the outsider issues related to the

establishment of these positions may seem like highly intangible, overly convoluted,

or trivial details, but I think we rightly assign them the utmost importance. They are

the stuff of our cosmologies and our cosmologies are the source of our ultimate

meaning and spirituality, and by extension the basis of our understandings, norms,

ethics, actions, social, political and economic behaviors. Wars have been fought,

empires forged and lost, and the dominant modes of existence for virtually everyone

                                                                                      10

who has ever lived have been prescribed by the prevalence of spiritually orientated,

epistemologically grounded worldviews or more materially orientated, ontologically

grounded worldviews. (Harman, 1998) As Mark Edwards, foremost scholar of the

### practice of meta-theorizing itself, notes:

       the impact of social theory, and particularly of big-picture theorising, can

       occasionally be so deep and so ubiquitous that there could hardly be a more

       powerful example of the influence of ideas on the concrete social practices

       and lived human experience. (2010, pp.47)

As an aside and to clarify: ontologically orientated views need not be founded in the

requirement that everything stem from material causes or from matter/energy as such.

Certainly Bhaskar’s ontological position is not: real things need not be ‘material’ in

his view (Collier, 1994), nor are they ultimately grounded necessarily in

matter/energy in the foundational mechanisms of the intransitive domain of his

system of ‘depth ontology’. However, the general feeling by modern Western

scientifically informed views is such that any ontological position will lack rigor

unless it can be interpreted that way.

Wilber asserts that, while not fundamentally materialist, Bhaskar, with his

investigation into the possibility of science and the development of CR/MR,

constructs a view that prioritizes ontology over epistemology and in fact separates

them as distinct domains. In a recent article in the Journal of Integral Theory and

### Practice, Wilber states:

       CR separates epistemology and ontology, and makes ontology the level of the

       “real”; whereas, for Integral Theory, epistemology and ontology cannot so be

                                                                                     11

       fragmented and fractured, but rather are two correlative dimensions of every

       Whole occasion (part of the tetra-dimension of every holon). (2013, pp. 43)

Bhaskar in an article published in the same Journal edition rejoins on Wilber’s

### comments:

       I do not “suck consciousness out of all being and then make being the basis of

       the real.” On the contrary, I start with consciousness–in experimental activity–

       and ask what it presupposes. (2013, pp.40)

Here, we see that Bhaskar does not accept that he is on the ontological side of the

cosmological divide; nor does Wilber accept that he be relegated to the

epistemological side. Wilber’s assertion about Bhaskar’s position is based on his own

grounding philosophical view. In an article transcribed as a summary, for Bhaskar, by

Paul Marshall, of a conversation he had with Wilber where Wilber lays out his core

criticisms of CR/MR, Marshall elaborates on this point saying,

       Wilber’s main criticism of Critical Realism is based on his panpsychism (or

       pan-interiorism, as he prefers to call it in his writings). For him, the universe is

       made up of sentient beings with perspectives, “all the way down” to sub-

       atomic particles (in the form of Whiteheadian prehension). (2013, pp.35)

Wilber’s integration of panpsychism/pan-interiorism (epistemology) with the

requirement to specify the method (methodology) in enacting objects (ontology) is

perhaps best summed up by a statement used by Wilber to articulate his ‘post-

metaphysical’ stance: “the meaning of a statement is the injunction of its enactment.”

(Wilber 2006, p.268) While Wilber’s panpsychic, post-metaphysical view within IT

may appear to be a more integrative stance than Bhaskar’s CR/MR ontology, it still

                                                                                      12

demonstrates a bias by making the meaning of an assertion about reality (ontology)

contingent on injunctions (methodology) of enactment (epistemology). It also suffers

from a serious criticism in the eyes of Critical Realists. It is a criticism upon which

the full weight of Bhaskar’s core philosophical edifice is brought to bear: CR/MR’s

transcendental argument that purports to establishes the independent ontological

status of real things independent of any knowing subject. (Bhaskar 2002) In relation

to Wilber’s position from a CR/MR perspective, it is worth quoting Nick Headlund-de

### Witt at length:

       The claim here is that the ontological status or being of an object is brought

       forth through the consciousness (epistemic structures) and behavior

       (methodological injunctions) of the knowing subject—the being engaged in

       the enactment. But what then, a critical realist might ask, is the ontological

       status of the one who enacts? This appears to be overlooked by IT as it has

       been explicitly articulated to date, yet there appears to be an implicit

       presupposition and thus concession of the ontological existence or reality of at

       least one object—that is, the being engaged in the process of enactment—

       since in order for that being to enact anything at all, it must first exist as an

       real entity or object. Thus, IT and its post-metaphysical theory of enactment

       seems to necessarily presuppose the ontological existence or ‘givenness’ of at

       least one intransitive object. How can the being of an object be constituted

       through the process of enactment, if the process of enactment is inexorably

       driven by—and contingent on—a being that is itself an object? In this way,

       from the vantage point of CR, in order to begin the process of enacting or

       knowing anything, one must presuppose some kind of philosophical

       ontology—some kind of ‘metaphysics’ if you will. And following Bhaskar’s

                                                                                         13

        transcendental argument, such an ontology or metaphysical proposition must

        presuppose the existence of an enactment-independent or pregiven world.

        Therefore, when Wilber claims that “post-metaphysical thinking does not rely

        on the existence of a pregiven world,” he appears to be unaware of the

        tautological and self-contradictory logic undergirding this so-called post-

        metaphysical position…” (2013, pp. 8)

Or is he necessarily? Bhaskar’s transcendental argument is just that–and it may only

be posited by a subject! Powerful as transcendental arguments may be, no doubt, in

part, by virtue of the fact that they have been employed to good effect by Kant (and of

course, also by Bhaskar) and thereby endowed with a certain philosophical currency,

in no use are they immune to the criticism that they can only be employed by a

subject in the first instance: immediate subjective experience is our sole means of

primacy. In this light it is not necessarily logically clear that “in order to begin the

process of enacting or knowing anything, one must presuppose some kind of

philosophical ontology” when the only way this presupposition can be made is by first

experiencing as a subject. Or, as Wilber might contend, the subject doing the enacting

is in fact a subject/object (holon), as these two perspectives cannot be divided.

Here we see the problem: neither argument is able to emphatically claim the

foundational position. To try and do so leads only to an infinite regress wherein the

existence of one side of the duality presupposes the pre-existence of the other, ad

infinitum. Or to put it another way, a foundational metaphysical given must be

arbitrarily specified in any case: either experience or objects. To be fair, although

Bhaskar is not in any way denying subjectivity, it does appear that in emphatically

refusing to separate the subject from the object (or the possibility of reducing one to

                                                                                         14

the other), Wilber has the more integrated view. IT as Wilber is at pains to point out

also has its own ontology. (Wilber, 2013) However, this does not change the fact that

each side interprets, perhaps astutely, the stance of the other as signifying an

unnecessary dualism, even though, as we will see there may be a method for

reconciling the truth of both views. My point in reviewing this debate is that perhaps

we are barking up the wrong philosophical trees, so to speak. Furthering this

discussion will only see us flip flop ever closer on either side of the cosmological

divide without ever landing on it. However, if we were to actually land on it, perhaps

we could enter onto a living structure that by its dynamism does not so easily get

located in these dualities.

Remember that from a pragmatic or more properly as pragmatisist perspective (that

is, the effects we see these respective views to have and thereby use to evaluate them

objectively) these philosophical discussions ultimately come down to meaning and

interpretation–their significance. No matter how subtle the interpretation that these

positions lie on one side or the other of this duality, it is of profound importance that

this splitting is in fact happening. If they are vying to provide the ground of our

fundamental view of reality in an emerging integrative world-space, then their

respective dualities will preclude the establishment of a cosmological view that has

the potential to resonate with the constituents of all the major planetary worldviews. If

it sits on the ontological side, a view will offend traditional and integral ‘spiritual’

sensibilities; and, if it sits on the epistemological side, it will offend the essentially

materialist (or at least naturalistic), ‘flatland’ orientations of modernity/post-

modernity. As I stated earlier, both philosophies have legitimate claims, within their

own constructs, to nondual status; however, clearly they are not being interpreted that

                                                                                           15

way by each other. Explicitly or implicitly, Wilber accuses CR/MR of predicating an

ontological fallacy, and Bhaskar associates IT with what he has termed the epistemic

fallacy. In the wider field of their engagement, they do not generate the basis for a

nondual cosmology. However subtly, each is interpreting the meaning of the other’s

position as dualistic–as either idealism or realism respectively.

       Edgar Morin brings to his work a depth of philosophical and theoretical rigour

comparable to Bhaskar’s and Wilber’s, however his approach is not to work primarily

from the establishment of a philosophical position or theoretical framework. He

deliberately constructs a Method, a kind of ‘active inquiry’, which takes as its central

and foundational rational the refusal to be pinned down in dualistic thought.

             ‘Morin’ s broader vision of complexity and of thought explicitly connects

             reason and emotion, wisdom and compassion, idealism and realism, and the

             other oppositions that have been created and are representatives of what he

             calls “ simple thought.”’ (Montuori, 2004)

Through the idea of complexity and the discipline of Complex Thought, Morin, then,

is contributing an essential component to integrative work. His Method points out the

subtle interpreted duality created through the establishment of epistemological and

ontological positions, no matter how ‘nondual’ they may intend to be in-and-of

themselves. This approach gives us a means of resolution. As Alfonso Montouri

points out, “Morin’s method outlines a way of approaching inquiry that does not

reduce or separate, and does justice to the complexity of life and experience.” (Morin,

2008) For Morin understanding complexity becomes the means of integrating

dualities. And as do both Wilber and Bhaskar, he understands the importance of the

connection between nonduality, the deep meaning of a spirituality so situated, and the

                                                                                         16

provision of an integrated world. Montuori states that

        The fact that the introductory chapter to the first volume of [Morin’s] Method

        is called The Spirit of the Valley, drawing explicitly on the Taoist tradition, is

        significant in many ways, pointing to what Morin calls the dialogical (not

        dialectical because there is no guaranteed resolution) relationship between

        traditional polarities, and to a deep, underlying spiritual thread running

        throughout Morin’s work. It reminds us that the spiritual is always present in

        his work, but in a far subtler way than has become the norm these days. (2004)

Theoretical and philosophical positions are indispensible and necessary. But, it is only

when we have a way of resolving the final dualities they create that we have a

sufficient integrative ‘way’ that is not inclined to be interpreted as dualistic and that is

therefore meaningfully nondual. This is so precisely because a way of inquiry about a

complex world is inherently much more fluid than is the business of describing

philosophical or theoretical foundations of that world. This fluidity imparts the ability

to ‘shift’ dynamically and continuously–an idea to which we will return–so as to

avoid being pinned unnecessarily to one side or the other of thought in a static

position. Morin has set us on this path by focusing (perspectivally) on the dynamics

and patterns that manifest as the organisation of complexity itself, and how these help

us understand and therefore signal to each other about the nature of our complex

reality in effective and fully integrated ways. His secret is that engaging in complexity

allows him to focus on a method of integrative meaning making. Morin illuminates

the central position described by the relationship between an integrative ‘how’ (form

of inquiry/Method) and the generation of the field that makes possible a complex

integrated ‘we’ (perspectival system). This points strongly to a connection between

                                                                                       17

our method of signalling, the meaning we make of it, and therefore what we

collectively enact as the real. This puts us firmly in the domain of sign theory and a

foundationally semiotic approach, which is the topic we engage next.

Semiotic Enactment (SE)

Having spent some time now on the context of this argument, we must now travel

more quickly, the strategy being one of design wherein if the challenge is to invent

the glove, a thorough investigation of the contours of the hand will be the most

productive portion of one’s time. It is perhaps ambitious to cover so much ground,

given the limitations of this paper; however, our purpose here is not necessarily to

make an overly comprehensive case at this time, but to build on the idea of previously

developed theory (SE), and to speculate on the outlines of a related and emergent

inquiry. This must then be carried forward and formed iteratively (or rejected as

inaccurate) by those methods both active and revealed.

Below is a review of my previous construction (Winton, 2010 a) of SE from Sean

Esbjörn-Hargen’s (2010) IET. In a move that seeks to establish a more pluralistic

approach within AQAL Integral Theory and Practice, Esbjörn-Hargens, no doubt

influenced to some degree by his recent connection with Bhaskar and CR/MR, and

perhaps too motivated by the vision of steering IT back to a more convincingly

nondual position given Wilber’s post-metaphysical turn, makes a case for remedying

the fact that while methodological pluralism is explicit and epistemological pluralism

is implicit within IT, “curiously there is no mention of ontological pluralism within

Integra Theory.” (Esbjörn-Hargens, 2010 pp. 146) Figure 1 represents the “triadic

                                                                                       18

combination… Integral Epistemological Pluralism (IEP), Integral Methodological

Pluralism (IMP), and Integral Ontological Pluralism (IOP). Integral Pluralism forms

the basis of what I am calling Integral Enactment Theory (IET).” (Ibid, pp. 146)

       Figure 1   Integral Enactment Theory (from Esbjörn-Hargens, 2010)

To look at IET from a semiotic perspective, in Figure 2, I simplify the diagram and

focus on the ‘double hermeneutic’–the fact that not only do (multiple but overlapping)

subjects ‘enact’ (multiple but overlapping) objects, but objects are seen also to

influence the subject (via multiple but overlapping methods).

       Figure 2    Diagram showing “double hermeneutic” in Integral Enactment

In Figure 3, the double hermeneutic is transformed into a diagram that signifies

‘semiotic’ activity, where the multiple and overlapping infinity/figure-of-eight like

                                                                                      19

lines represent an ongoing process of signalling and interpretation (hermeneutic) by a

subject (which must also have an objective dimension if it is in turn being interpreted)

signalling and interpreting an object (which also has a subjective dimension if it is in

any way ‘interpreting’ or determining something of the subject).

       Figure 3     Diagram of ‘Semiotic’ Implicit in Double Hermeneutic

In Figure 4 multiple and overlapping oval lines are added to Figure 3 to signify the

enactment of a pattern of organization by the ongoing activity of the relationship

between the two subject/objects (holons in their own right) that then form a higher

order (bounded) holon (forming a holarchy) or complex perspectival system. Semiotic

enactment signifies the process that illustrates the Source pattern of the creation of all

meta-types–where meta-types are very foundational dynamic patterns that serve as

organizing fields within complex systems of (semiotically) interacting parts.

                                                                                      20

       Figure 4    Diagram signifying Semiotic Enactment

SE demonstrates a more dynamic, iterative, systems forming, process orientated take

on IET, which is itself an elaboration of the AQAL Integral framework. SE is founded

in mutual active inquiry (semiotic/method) of signaling and interpretation between

perspectives that shifts IET to show a different and complimentary view emphasizing

the complex systems dimension of perspectival realities. This generates a range of

possibilities, including the use of diagrams like the ones above to symbolize a range

of known patterns of organization from systems/complexity disciplines as a language

for thinking, communicating (collective inquiry of meaning making) and designing

from a perspective of complexity itself. For our purposes here, it is sufficient to have

demonstrated SE’s relationship to IET, IET’s (and therefore the Integral framework’s)

inherently semiotic dimension, and how this move allows us to take a perspectival

complex systems view based on the enactment of dynamic patterns of organization.

Readers interested in leaning more about this process in more detail, or in learning

more about a theory of meta-types and their practical application for integrative work,

can see my paper, submitted as part of the proceedings of the 2010 Integral Theory

Conference, PatternDynamics: Creating Cultures of Sustainability (Winton, 2010a)

of Integral Theory and Practice (Winton, 2010b)

Figure 5 overlays the toroidal shaped semiotic ‘holon’ (part/whole) diagram

representing SE over the diagram representing the IT Quadrants, illustrating the fact

that they are different but complimentary ways of representing the foundational holon

meta-type: SE signifying a more dynamic, semiotic, feminine/relational, perspectival

systems view; IT representing a more static, theoretical, masculine/distinction-

making, perspectival ‘map’ (cartographical) view. Both demonstrate the integration of

primordial perspectives at the ‘semiotic point’ in the middle of the diagram.

       Figure 5   Diagram showing relationship of SE to the IT

The exercise above is undertaken to elucidate the central integrative role that a

semiotic approach can play within the creation of a meaningfully nondual view. We

are beginning to identify the mechanisms of a process that will allow us to see the

complex interactions of perspectives themselves. SE associates the ‘how’ of inquiry

(method) with the integrative role of the second-person perspective–the ‘we’ or the

subjective meaning that brings holons together as greater holons (holarchies/complex

perspectival systems). This in turn emphasizes the centrality of the ‘we’ forming

function of semiotics, and it positions the process of semiotic ‘meaning making’ as

the bridging territory between subjective/epistemologically orientated views and

objective/ontologically orientated views. Methodology, in its most general sense, as

the requirement of a primordial semiotic process, therefor becomes the keystone and

foundational logic for constructing an integral nondual cosmology.

The Cosmic Logic of C. S. Peirce

The founder of semiotics, Charles Saunders Peirce, was first and foremost a logician,

and he brought to this vocation a certain naturalistic orientation. He is one of the most

important founders, in the latter part of the 19th century, of the American pragmatist

tradition (which included the likes of John Dewey and William James). He is

increasingly recognized as America’s preeminent philosophical thinker. Peirce wrote

a prodigious volume of work throughout his life that continued to evolve and

consolidate his triadic semiotic structure (sign/object/interpretant) as the central pillar

of his logic and the idea that in the end logic and any attendant metaphysics must be

grounded in method that acts to understand the means of signification. Within the

post-modern milieu semiotics has been associated with signs, their objects,

interpretation and meaning making at the level of human communication, specifically

in language (the ‘text’). However, Peirce’s “Classical pragmatasism insisted that

interpretants were fully part of nature and that the sign/object/interpretant correlation

was not confined to the human process and its allegedly arbitrary cultural codes.”

(Corrington, 1994 pp. 5) Later in his career Peirce made a distinction with regard to

his own work calling it ‘pragmatasism’ as opposed to what he felt was a degenerate,

populists form promoted by James and others of the original idea of pragmatism.

Pragmatasism adds to pragmatism “the key recognition that all of reality moves

                                                                                      23

toward forms (my emphasis) of connectedness that give evidence to general laws and

principles within an evolving universe… it starts and ends with continuity.” (Ibid)

Clearly, Peirce saw semiotics as native to more that just human language, or what we

could look at as ‘anthroposemiotics’. Within it he saw the possibility of its actions in

the evolutionary unfolding of life (biosemiotics) and in fact the evolution of the wider

cosmos. Peirce did not explicitly extend semiotic to physical realities; however, I do

not think he specifically precluded it. Within the renewed and extended field of a

more general semiotics, and within the spirit of Peirce’s naturalistic leanings, it has

been cast farther back in cosmological time in the form of geosemiotics

(physiosemiotics), and I will propose that it can also function as a logic of the trans-

rational domains–the theosphere (theosemiotics) and the ‘causal’ domain

(kosmosemiotics). Figure 6 arranges these categories to graphically signify ‘semiotic

depth’ in relation to the schema of evolutionary depth illustrated by an AQAL Integral

diagram of Quadrants and Lines.

                                                                                        24

       Figure 6 Diagram of Semiotic Depth

Peirce conceived of his semiotic (or ‘semeiotic’ as he sometimes preferred to spell it)

as the irreducible triadic relationship involved in any form of thought or inference,

where our means of inference (claiming to know something) is the defining act of

logic, and logic is of course the basis of reason. Semiotic logic, for Peirce, was

superior to conventional dyadic forms of logic, where a thought (sign) ‘appears’ in the

mind as a relation to something (the object). Semiotic adds a third requirement–that

any thought (sign) must be interpreted (interpretant)–must be brought to signify

something–to develop any meaning in relation to something else (object). It places

actively evolving relationality as the connection between the ‘subject’ experiencing

and the ‘object’ experienced; or, in other words, it introduces methodology as the

point of transmutation that precludes any real dualism between epistemology and

ontology. The emergent interpretant then forms a new sign, requiring interpretation in

relation to its object and so on in an ongoing, evolution of meaning that illuminates

the actual process of thought, or ‘thought processes’. Peirce conceived that we are

actually in the process of thought, rather like we might describe ourselves as being ‘in

motion’, rather than thoughts being in us.

Peirce’s semiotic has three foundational categories: Firstness, Secondness and

Thirdness. We can relate Firstness to the sign; Secondness to the object; and,

Thirdness to the interpretant. This is a somewhat crude review of Peirce’s seemingly

inexhaustible development of his triadic formulations, and it simplifies the matter at

the risk of conflating the categories with the things situated within them. However, we

do not need a high degree of granularity here, only a recognizably accurate image. In

an oft-used example Peirce relates that a child, having no conception of a ‘hot stove’,

upon touching one will via Firstness sense a feeling (sign), which then encounters the

                                                                                      25

thing it is related to, or its ‘referent’ (object), as a ‘brute fact’–the pain of touching the

stove. It is only in Thirdness, through an interpretation (interpretant) of the sign

(Firstness) that places it in relation to the ‘hot’ (Secondness) of the stove, that the sign

becomes meaningful and therefor a source of knowledge to the child. In his text An

Introduction to C.S. Peirce, Robert S. Corrington, the interpreter of Peirce’s work

who perhaps best understands the importance of his naturalism, explains of Peirce’s

### system:

        His founding category of firstness refers to the undifferentiated quality and

        potentiality prior to any stain of the actual… The category of thirdness refers

        to the rational law like habits that govern the world and which make meaning

        possible. The category of secondness, as the name implies, refers to the brute

        dyadic interaction that is prior to signification or fulfilled meaning. (1993, pp.

        45)

These categories contain a broad logic. We have now isolated the essence of semiotic

process as a relation of one thing to another through signification (a Third). In reality

though, even a relatively simple system with all its multiple parts and

interrelationships would create a field of intersecting semiotic interactions of

unimaginably complexity. I will argue that these fields are at work in the creation

(and maintenance and evolution) of any set of relationships where parts interact to

assemble wholes (or scalar hierarchies of wholes, holarchies) and create organized

‘form’–whether those forms are semiotically enacted in the physiosphere, the

biosphere, the noosphere, the theosphere or the kosmosphere. Semiotic is the logical

foundation wherever a precedent thing signifies something of an antecedent thing.

Does not the hexagonal stone column signify the crystalline order the basalt magma

preceding it? Does not the chemical scent of a flower signify its nectar to the bee; the

                                                                                         26

word, its referent; an archetype, a story; witnessing, a causal field? And in each of

those instances are we not evidencing a mechanism for the coming into organization

of Peirce’s “forms of connectedness that give evidence to general laws and principles

within an evolving universe.” If so, then, we have located a realist approach to

pansemiotics.

integral Semiotic Realism (iSR)

In Figure 7, the diagram signifies the dynamic pattern of a primordial semiotic

process. It serves as the basis of an integral Semiotic Realism (iSR) supportive of a

naturalistic pansemiotics as the foundational mechanism of a viable integrative

nondual cosmology and the positioning of Integral Rational Spirituality (IRS) within

it.

The diagram signifying iSR shows a relationship among elements of Wilber, Bhaskar,

Morin, and Peirce’s work and integrates them within that system. Firstness is located

with resect to Wilber’s 1st person/interior, subjective perspective–the Upper Left

Quadrant (epistemology). Peirce does not explicitly associate Firstness with the first

person pronoun or the ‘subject’, but he does describe it as something like pure

phenomenological experience when he states that it must be

       “entirely separate from all conception of or reference to anything else… The

       First must therefore be present and immediate… It is also something vivid and

       conscious; so only it avoids being the object of some sensation.” (1991,

       pp.190)

The arrows on the oval-like shape on the left hand side of the diagram indicate that

the sign emerges as a quality of Firstness from what is termed the ‘nondual origin’ in

                                                                                      27

an epistemic emergence of, as Peirce put it, ‘feeling’. In this process it undergoes an

arc of evolution as it heads back to its origin in the nondual return. Here the sign

progresses back through the nondual origin to encounter Secondness, which is located

with Wilber’s 3rd person/exterior, objective perspective–the Right-Hand Quadrants

(ontology). Peirce (Ibid pp.189) describes Secondness as something clearly about

objectiveness when he says that “it is something which is there, and which I cannot

think away, but am forced to acknowledge as an object or second besides myself…”

The sign/object then undergoes an ontological emergence and evolution through to its

own nondual return to its source to reacquaint, as a fully distinct ‘other’, with its

Firstness. Here it travels to the outside oval. Next it moves around the oval through a

process of signification and obtains Thirdness. Thirdness is located with Wilber’s 2nd

person/cultural, inter-subjective perspective-the Lower Left Quadrant. Thirdness “as a

category, refers to the power of mediation that brings the earlier dyadic structure into

a higher form of relationality, a relationality that is intelligible and that manifests law-

like regularity.” (Corrington, 1993 pp.125) Thirdness brings a new quality of ‘law-

like’ order or ‘habit’, as Peirce would say, to the concept of the 2nd person space. It is

through a method of inquiry that the ‘sign-ificance’ of the relationship between

epistemology and the ontology can be transformed into a dynamic pattern of order.

This is the essence of semiotic enactment.

It is worth noting that SE specifies that every act of Firstness will also have a

concomitant act of Secondness; and likewise Secondness, Firstness. Any relation is a

relation between holons and therefore the diagram should be more complicated and

have arrows and processes running in both directions. Rather like the reciprocal

transfer of water and minerals from the roots to the leaves, versus the transit of

photosynthesized sugars from the leaves to the roots in the spreading roots, trunk and

                                                                                       28

canopy of a tree. This image helps illustrate the more three dimensional dynamic

torus pattern that cannot be signified so easily through a two dimensional diagram.

       Figure 7 Diagram Representing the Process of integral Semiotic Realism

The ‘nondual origin’ in the center of the diagram signifies what we have not yet

discovered empirically (an may never) about the nature of reality (the intransitive

domain CR/MR; zone of subsistence IT). Here we can declare our metaphysics, and

like Peirce simply admit that there are certain categories we need to speculate on, or

‘believe’, in order to generate any fully transparent foundational philosophical view.

Scientific inquiry may illuminate the mechanisms of our speculations over time–if

they are real–and our speculations may provide hypotheses to assist in that work. It is

not clear that transcendental argumentation or an appeal to post-metaphysics will

necessarily add anything here.

The speculative postulate central to iSR (an eminently naturalistic one), and the one

that supports its nondual stance is that: remaining (and evolving) from the explosive

                                                                                    29

energy event of the singularity that initiated our cosmos (The Big Bang), there is a

persistent aspect of this nondual origin that imparts a ‘unititiveness’ to all of

existent/transitive reality. The nondual is present as both subsistent/intransitive origin

and the ongoing evolution of all existent/transitive things that emanate from it. It is

non-local, non-temporal, and a dimension where there is no duality of Firstness and

Secondness or the relation between them, Thirdness (no epistemology; no ontology;

no methodology–the collapse of the semiotic triad). And, we need to give the standard

declaration that descriptions of nonduality itself are therefore impossible–including

this one, so we will have to proceed by a kind of pragmatic false analogy. Having said

that, it is the view here that it is possible for what Bhaskar terms ‘mechanisms’–the

basis of his foundational ontological level, the real–to subsist in the nondual and be

efficacious in the transitive domain of existence. It is just that there is no way to

signify the nature of how they might subsist as nonduality.

By virtue of being of that ‘unitiveness’ everything is connected to everything else and

the possibility of any sort of relationship (and therefor the semiotic enactment of any

existing ‘real thing’/holon) whatsoever is predicated on this unified nondual basis of

reality. An aspect of the original cosmic singularity persists and predicates the

relatedness of the parts of anything that comes to be existent (enacted) as a

holon/complex perspectival system (IT); or, in other words, that comes to be a

transitive object in the actual or empirical domains (CR/MR). This is consistent with

Bhaskar’s view that “the non-dual is not only ubiquitous and indispensable to any

mode of (human) being or eventuation, it is prior to dual forms and phenomena,

which are unilaterally existentially dependent of them.” (Bhaskar, 2002 pp. 10) He

calls this the ‘ground state’ where the “ground state is in its essence non-dual, though

it may manifest in dual beings…” (Bhaskar, 2002,b pp lvi) It is also consistent with

                                                                                        30

quantum theory, at least in the notion derived from it, of non-locality as one

explanation of quantum effects.

This naturalistic speculation on the nature of nonduality is the basis by which any

form of semiotic is possible. It provides the Realism in integral Semiotic Realism: The

Real signifies the nondual.

The actual, which sits between Bhaskar’s intransitive domain and the empirically

knowable, is placed in the zone of the diagram where Firstness and Secondness are in

relation–where there is an ‘actual’ occurrence–but before Thirdness confers upon it

the law-like pattern of its relations (order) that enables us to empirically know it.

From Panpsychism to Pansemiotism

The semoitic realism of iSR is then a naturalistic, nondual realism that promotes a

naturalistic, realist pansemiotics. The advantage of this type of pansemiotics over

Wilber’s Whiteheadian panpsychism is that thought (subjective interiority, psych or

‘mind’) does not need to be carried down into the physical domain to do duty as a

partner to material and efficient causes to explain the self-organizing capacity of an

early evolving universe. I don’t think a panpsychist approach will ever be accepted by

modern sensibilities. It will always suffer from the homunculus critique–(Deacon,

2012) the interpretation that a little ‘mind’ has been snuck into a domain that should

not include anything related to ‘mind’ or indeed ‘interiority’ as such. Signs perhaps,

but not ‘subjects’. Panpsychism is a dualistic approach and the perspective of

modernity has called it out. I think modernity will ultimately reject any spirituality of

this ilk and therefore any ultimate meaning that could come of it.

                                                                                       31

A sign in the (pan)semiotic sense, however, while signifying a thought (mental

occurrence/thing/holon) at the mental level (noosphere), need not be construed as one

at the biological level (biosphere). Here a sign (a biological occurrence/thing/holon)

can be interpreted as a process of organic signification through macro-molecular

inquiry. At the physical level a sign (physical thing/occurrence/holon) need not rely

on a panpsychic appeal to ‘prehension’–its significance can be driven by the inquiry

of the actions and relations, in the main, of material and efficient causes. If in this last

statement you sense a drift into outright materialism, then we need to incorporate a

strategy for bringing in formal, and final causes to unite the full Aristotilian quadrat of

types of causes so as to avoid the critisim that physiosemiotics is just materialism in

disguise. Spirit has traditionally done duty as an explanation for final causes, where it

provides the teleological pull (direction) for the eros of an unfolding (evolving)

cosmos. If we are going to effectively remove that kind of spirit (the all pervasive,

pan-interior kind) from this part of our schema, by our rejection of panpsychism, then

we will need to find a suitable replacement for its role as a cosmological final cause.

Energy Quality

This takes us to the inquiry of Stanley N. Salthe, a theoretical biologist with a

naturalistically orientated interest in general (cosmological) evolution and the notion

that energy can develop in quality. To satisfy his own naturalistic cosmological

inquiry Salthe asks the question why does anything exist at all? His answer is that

“the universal has been accelerating so fast (since the Big Bang/singularity expansion)

that the universe has been unable to remain in equilibrium internally… [and] This

expansion beyond the range of possibility for global equilibrium gave rise to the

precipitation of matter, which might be viewed as delayed energy.” (Salthe, 2013 pp.

2) Equilibrium is the state of lowest energy quality of a system. In this state it

                                                                                       32

contains the most randomness–or alternatively, the least information)–where

information is a measure of order. Matter, because of its orderedness in relation to the

equilibrium state sought by the rest of the cosmos, contains an energy gradient. The

natural force of the universe is to get back to equilibrium by degrading

(randomizing/’entropizing’) any energy gradient. This tendency is expressed as the

2nd law of thermodynamics as elucidated, in the mid-nineteen century by Carnot’s

work in energy transformation efficiencies and later Clausius’ statement regarding the

relation of the direction of heat transfer in work.

Work is possible because energy gradients are there to provide the energy to do it.

Work, an ordered process or system, that uses available energy (the energy gradient)

to do something productive, could be viewed as the universe’s way of getting back to

equilibrium. This is why organized systems, in the complexity sciences, whether they

are physical or biological–and I will argue, whether they are also mental, subtle or

causal–are referred to as far from equilibrium systems or dissipative systems. Salthe

notes that a scalar hierarchy of energy gradients exists in the scalar hierarchy of

dissipative systems evident in the cosmos: there is a lot of low-gradient energy (in the

form of simpler more primitive forms of cosmic order like atoms and molecules and

their clumping together into things like suns and the energy flows that radiate from

them); this huge amount of lower-grade energy of the physiosphere is transformed by

biological dissipative systems into energetically more qualitatively complex systems

but less energetically quantitative systems–the ‘wasted’ energy dissipated as heat

entropy. The same could be said for the activities of the noosphere, which leap up

again in energy quality, but reduce in quantity. For Salthe, the 2nd law of

thermodynamics specifies a final cause in cosmic evolution. For him, evolution is

                                                                                      33

pulled along or steered (telos) by the foundational law that the future is dictated by an

equilibrium state.

We will take a slightly different view and propose the so-called 4th law of

thermodynamics as an alternative source of naturally situated final causes. In the early

twentieth century, when the study of energy in life systems was starting to be

explored, Alfred J. Lotka (1922 pp. 147) noted that

       It had been pointed out by Boltzmann that the fundamental object of

       contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is

       available energy [energy gradients]. In accord with this observation is the

       principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those

       organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing

       available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.

Now we have a view that is less about the dissipation of energy gradients as an end in

itself and much more about how well the organizational forms of dissipative systems

(their energy quality or complexity) is suited to compete in the niche specified by an

available energy flow (gradient). In order to exist, dissipative systems are driven to

continually invest their harvested energy in complexifying (increase their energy

quality) in order to maximize their rate of continuing to harvest that energy flow.

Their very evolutionary persistent existence (sustainability) depends on it. Howard T.

Odum, founder of the discipline of systems ecology, called this requirement the

Maximum Power Principle and proposed it as the 4th law of thermodynamics.

(Odum, 1995) For Odum, the evolutionary competition to increase the complexity

(quality) of dissipative systems was a principle in itself. He coined the term Emergy

to denote, and provide a basis for measuring, the total quantity of low-grade energy it

                                                                                       34

takes to create a higher-grade more complex form. Emergy (with an ‘m’) stands for

energy memory.

Rather that viewing the tendency of the universe to seek thermodynamic equilibrium

(2nd law) as a final cause, and thereby making the continued energy transformaties

into more and more complex dissipative structures (including, biological, mental,

subtle, and causal structures) an enabling byproduct of this process, could we not look

at it the other way around? Could it not be that the fundamental tendency of the

cosmos is to expand a huge amount of energy quantity that will transform into smaller

but more complex scalar holarchies of evolving energy quality? This makes more

logical sense as the expansion comes before the need to reinstate equilibrium. What if

the tendency to equilibrium and the entropy so generated is simply the price for

winding up complex holarchies? Or, to shift our perspective a little more, what if the

4th law specifies the habit the cosmos has developed for completing the grand

semiotic arch though increasing orders of signification back to its own nondual

ground. Could the ‘aliveness’ of energy and its proclivity to ‘wind up’ not be our

source of telos or final cause, which is ultimately to return to its own nondual source.

This is why the torus diagram is useful for signifying iSR. It illustrates a process that

is formed so as to continually evolve to feed back to its origins.

The Pragmatics of Spiritual Signification

Let me clarify the position of iSR. While it is grounded in a foundational naturalism–

that is, in a commonsense view that the mechanisms of nature are revealable by us–it

does not require an appeal to eliminative materialism (a view that eliminates all but

material causes). This would situate it in a type of subtly dualistic, realism. Nor does

it require an all-pervasive spirit, which, alternatively, creates a type of equally subtly

                                                                                      35

dualistic, idealism. iSR is a thoroughgoing nondual view that associates the

intransitive dimension (zone of subsistence) with the underlying oneness–non-local,

non-temporal, not-twoness of mind/spirit/idealism v matter/energy/realism–of the

singularity that originated our cosmos. All things that come to exist in the transitive

domain do so entirely contingent on the fact that they are, moment to moment,

(re)aquainted with their nondual essence through the semiotic relational evolutionary

process that is predicated on their subsistence as nonduality. iSR requires only three

foundational types of semiotic triads (a triad of triads if you will) to emerge from the

nondual oneness, the intransitive domain, into the actual domain to provide the

### categories upon which all empirical phenomenon can then be enacted:

1. sign/interpretant/object (extension of energy)

2. origin/interpretant/evolution (extension of time)

3. parts/interpretant/wholes (extension of space)

The first of these, energy, has a curios ontological status. It potentiates change; we

can measure and quantify its effects, but we cannot measure and quantify it. No one

has ever encountered energy as a substance. It’s ontological status (quantity) is

dependent on its quality of inducing change–quality being something we normally

associate with epistemological status. Therefore, in the concept of energy lies the

extension into the actual, from the intransitive, of the sign/object relationship, and

therefor it has a certain ‘aliveness’ that animates and enchants reality. Notice, neither

sign (Firstness) nor object (Secondness) nor their interpretant (Thirdness) exist in the

nondual ground. No-‘thing’ exists there, per se, at all: there is only singularity. But,

correspondingly everything subsists there. Within iSR Mechanisms (in the Bhaskarian

sense) subsist in the nondual origin and have effects on existence and by this they are

The Real, the ultimate category or ground state. Therefore it is not necessary, or

                                                                                         36

appropriate, in this view to locate or associate ‘spirit’ or ‘mind’ or any kind of

epistemological quality in/with the nondual, nor correspondingly should we locate or

associate any kind of ‘material’ or ‘objects’ or any kind of ontological quantity

in/with the nondual either. In our natrualisitic nondual cosmology the ultimate

category is the Real–nondual mechanisms; or, perhaps a less ontologically slanted

way of referring to these ‘mechanisms’ is to signify them as a type of efficaciousness

as nonduality. Spirit is existent of this efficaciousness: not the other way around and

not as equivalence.

This is where iSR parts company with IT and CR/MR and all approaches to

spirituality that locate spirit in, or associate it with, nondual realization. If we are of

and predicated on the nondual ground then it is within our nature to realize it (our

nature is its realization). Both Wilber and Bhaskar have pointed out that this is an

inescapable aspect of our everyday existence and that, in fact, it is impossible to

depart from it. Within iSR nondual realization is not signified as a spiritual

realization: it is signified as Realization itself. iSR takes the pragmatasist route and

(all other inferences being equal) rejects a ‘spiritual’ signification of the nondual by

virtue of its effects. One of the central and most important effects being that it

entrains a subtle dualism within the signification of the nondual by virtue of ‘spirit’s’

association with the epistemological side of the divide. As we have seen Wilber’s

position is interpreted this way, even by other post-formal approaches. Bhaskar is in

the strange position where because of the interpretation that CR/MR has

fundamentally realist ontological leanings by his post-formal-critics, it introduces a

subtle ontological dualism into the nondual from a post-formal perspective; but

CR/MR also introduces the opposite subtle epistemological dualism to modern views

                                                                                            37

via the interpretation of its ‘spiritual turn’ by Bhaskar’s more philosophically modern

adherents.

The key perception for modernity will be that there is an unacceptable

epistemological dualism in both IT and CR/MR’s approach to spirituality. Bhaskar

has caused considerable consternation among his more modern orientated supporters

with his ‘spiritual turn’. Wilber has suffered the slings and arrows of popular

discontent, by modernists of all stripes, who mostly reject his overarching spirituality,

at times associating it with an unhelpful fixation on populist and superficial

orientations to developmentalism, characterized by Zachary Stein as “the growth to

goodness assumptions (my emphasis)”. (2010, pp. 8) Arguably, too, the combination

of a perceived epistemic orientation of Wilber’s description of spirituality and flawed

views of developmentalism by some of his less sophisticated followers, has lead to, at

times, an unhelpful type of ‘spiritual fetishism’. (Winton, 2012) These interpretations

must be separated from Wilber’s work itself, which does not suffer from these lacks

in sophistication. The related pragmatic effect, and the most important one at this

time, is that the subtle epistemological dualism alienates the modern sensibility and

therefore hobbles the development of a much-needed source of ultimate meaning

there. In this sense, modernity is providing the evolutionary requirement to transcend

significations of spirituality that do not have the capacity to be meaningful for all

worldviews.

Both Wilber and Bhaskar have created strong integrative meaning for people with

post-formal orientations who are looking for the significance of deep interconnected

oneness available in communities of practice oriented to spiritual realities. The subtle

dualities in Wilber and Bhaskar’s respective nondual orientations do not bother their

adherents, nor should they in respect of those communities. They are mostly not

                                                                                      38

interpreted that way and therefore they are mostly not significant. In fact, it appears

that both IT and CR/MR act to provide the meaning that attracts people with post-

formal leanings remarkably well. Perhaps this will be their central and necessary role,

but it does not change the fact that they do not now, and do not look likely to have,

any deep appeal to modernity in their current forms. I make this assertion based on

personal experience as an integral practitioner working in the commercial realities of

modernity and based on observations of the scale of uptake of anything like integral

spirituality in the main stream of modernity. Again this is important because even if

we were to get demographically unprecedented levels of people shifting to post-

formal orientations, the rate of change by this process will still not likely have a

significant effect on modernity in relation to modifying the rate of its destructive

tendencies in a meaningful timeframe. The strategy must to be two-fold: attract

people to integral and equip them to work deeply within modernity with a way of

being, a cosmology, and a spirituality that engages modernity in a deeply meaningful

way.

Integral Rational Spirituality (IRS)

But how do we do that? iSR does not reject spiritually. Spiritual realities are fully

supported within it, but they are located in a way that recognizes at which levels of

semiotic depth they are expressed. In iSR, spirit and spirituality, are only significant

within the transpersonal, post-formal domains: the subtle energy fields, visions,

luminosities and radiant ecstasies of the theosphere and the causal

witnessing/presence field of the kosmosphere. Integral Rational Spirituality then is

### signified by two primary elements:

                                                                                        39

- firstly, by making spirituality contingent on theosemiotic and

               kosmosemiotic only (no association with the nondual ground that is

               different from the association obtained by activities of all levels of

               semiotic depth–that is, spirituality is not privileged in relation to the

               nondual); and,

- secondly, semiotic depth dictates that spirituality is not signified until

               the transpersonal levels and therefore contingent on beings evolved to

               that level (that is, spirit is not significant in the physiosphere, the

               biosphere, or the noosphere).

Signifying spiritual realities as Theosemiotic and the Kosmosemiotic still leaves a

challenge in relation to modernity. The question: “how are these spiritual realities

real?” must be answered.

Morphic Fields

Material and efficient causes are familiar to modernity and account for the majority of

explanations therein: material causes are by virtue of the substance out of which

something is composed. Efficient causes are simply what we normally mean when we

say one thing follows another because of it (one object bumping another for instance).

Energy itself plays the role of efficient causes here. We have examined a suitable final

cause (telos) in the 4th law of thermodynamics, but none of material, efficient, or final

causes allow a naturalistic semiotic realism to be endowed with the capacity to

prescribe organizational form. We need a convincing formal cause that explains how

the animating potency of the energetic eminence of the universe (final cause) signifies

order out of swirling and bumping (efficient cause) things (material cause) in order to

complete a convincing integral cosmology. And, we need to connect it with the Real

                                                                                         40

mechanisms of our naturalistic nonduality. This brings us to the work of biologist

Rupert Sheldrake, and his hypothesis of formative causation.

Sheldrake has pointed out, rather convincingly, that there are still many unsolved

problems with regard to conventional scientific explanations of morphogenesis. These

includes, the development of biological forms, which cannot be explained by DNA or

any other material part of an organism, and physical forms like crystals, whose form,

likewise, cannot be predicted from the known laws of physics. (Sheldrake, 1998)

Sheldrake relates that

       if an iron magnet, for example is cut up, each part is a whole magnet with a

       complete magnetic field. Or if a part is removed from a hologram, which is a

       physical record of interference patterns in the electro-magnetic field, this part

       can give rise to the entire organizational image… Such physical analogies to

       the holistic properties of living organisms are examples of field phenomena.

       Fields are not material objects, but regions of influence. (Ibid, pp. 78)

He subscribes to an

       Organismic philosophy of nature [that] has much in common with the

       Aristotelian tradition… It is more radical than vitalism in that it sees

       organisms at all levels of complexity, from subatomic particles to galaxies,

       and even to the entire cosmos, as alive. The organizing roles that used to be

       attributed to souls and vital factors are now thought of in terms of systems

       properties, patterns of information, emergent organizing principles, or

       organizing fields (my emphasis)… the concept of morphic fields [and morphic

       resonance]… represents an attempt to understand such organizing fields in an

       evolutionary spirit. (Ibid pp. 69)

                                                                                     41

He proposes that morphic fields work through a kind of memory of previous forms

that he calls ‘the presence of the past’, and that formative causation depends on a kind

of resonance with like past forms called morphic resonance. But,

       Unlike other forms of resonance, morphic resonance does not involve a

       transfer of energy from one system to another, but rather a non-energetic

       transfer of information. However, morphic resonance does resemble other

       know kinds of resonance in that it takes place on the basis of rhythmic patterns

       of activity. (Ibid, pp. 108)

Sheldrake has done a substantial amount of quality peer reviewed scientific research,

and proposed experiments that others have done to test his hypothesis. The results

have been encouraging, but politically the modernist scientific paradigm, despite the

mounting evidence, has yet to accept his views. This is evidenced by the recent

controversy over the removal of a video, hosted on a popular website, of his talk on

formative causation, for being ‘unscientific’. The widespread anger this provoked

among the generally modernist commentariat may indicate a turning of the tide, a

moment of that “Jung called enantiodromia whereby we become what we hate”

(Morin, 1999 pp. xxxviii) through an extreme action, of denial (of formative causation

in this case) that heralds the enactment of its opposite–acceptance of formative

causation. (Winton, 2013)

While Sheldrake’s fields of morphic resonance are a very good fit for our naturalistic

means of formal causation, interestingly he does not speculate as to how they work

other than to say they are non-energetic. We, however, can locate morphic fields in

the nondual, intransitive domain where every pattern of organization would subsist in

‘superposition’ (similar to the superposition prescribed in quantum theory) in non-

                                                                                     42

locality/non-temporality. In that way, the organizing patterns of the universe could be

seen as holographic in nature in that the sum total of all the organizing patterns of the

universe subsists in each of its parts. Also, the ‘presence of the past’ informing the

persistence and evolution of these forms would subsist in the telescoping of time in

non-temporality. Morphic resonance, the interference patterns that contain the ‘in-

form-ation’ of semiotic processes that create the forms, could be located in the actual

domain and the things themselves in the empirical domain where they would exist

empirically. Wherever there is form, then, there is ‘in-form-ation’. This implies

semiotic in that there must be an interpretation/signification for parts to come into

organized wholes rather than entropic randomness.

Conclusion

Our original purpose was driven by the pragmatic identification of an ‘absence’

within modernity that is causing a destructive pathology within the development of

Planetary Civilization. That absence is hypothesized as the lack of a cosmology that

demonstrates a place and a belonging in the universe in a way that is convincing and

meaningful within the rational paradigm of modernity.

Through an examination and integration of components of a range of thinkers we

have constructed the outlines of a pragmatasist, naturalistically orientated, nondual,

realist, integrative semiotic cosmology. The aim is to provide a Grand Story that has

the capacity to unify, while respecting the diversity of, the major worldviews. This

will only happen if that story can be interpreted in such a way that allows each

worldview to find ultimate meaning that is not exclusive of the way any of the others

do the same.

                                                                                       43

In constructing our cosmology we have preserved Wilber’s post-metaphysical

relationship between epistemology, methodology and ontology and Esbjorn-Hargens’

derivative ‘enactive’ paradigm; embedded Bhaskar’s realist approach to ontological

depth; and prioritized Morin’s view on Method. The centrality of signification via

method to nonduality is then extended and the notion of Semiotic Enactment is further

enhanced with C. S. Peirce’s semiotic philosophy to develop a mechanism termed

integral Semiotic Realism. Suitable material and efficient causes are derived from the

concept of energy as the primal emergent from the Big Bang; Salthe’s cosmological

proposition on the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is inverted and the related 4th Law is

substituted as a source of final causes; and, lastly, Sheldrake’s work on formative

causation via morphic resonance is instituted as a means of formal causes.

If it is not suitable in itself, the story located within this constellation of views can at

least provide the basis for a conversation about constructing a viable integrative

cosmology. A cosmology that can meet the requirement that it be interpreted in a way

that is not mutually exclusive, so as to be significant as a source of ultimate concern,

for traditional, modern, and integral worldviews alike. The hope is that Moderns will

accept it by virtue of its rational, naturalistic conceptions, approach to a limited–but

powerful–scope for spirituality within IRS, and the signification of nondual

Realization as the ultimate category.

I think traditional religious worldviews will be satisfied that modernity is accepting of

‘something greater than itself’–some sort of cosmological ultimate meaning, even if

this rational approach to ultimate meaning is not instantiated in their concept of God.

Also, because it is not based on eliminative materialism, there should be enough

scope to interpret, at least the possibility of, a broad conception of God by

traditionally oriented people.

                                                                                         44

Integrals, on the other hand, arguably, will have to make the most substantial

accommodation and shift the signification of the ultimate category from Spirit to The

Real–to a universe pervaded not by consciousness but by significance. The hope here

is that post-formal ways of being and the integral communities thereby formed can

grasp the flexibility they posses to shift perspectives, as specified by the dynamism of

iSR itself, and achieve a pragmatic outcome in service of the evolution of a better

future.

Modernity, by its acceptance of nondual realization (and IRS within it) as the ultimate

category and concern, would now share an ultimate bond and a renewed significance

for integrals that allows, for them, a realized modernity to be the meaning of

Planetary Civilization itself. The energy thwarted by the shadow and shame of being

unavoidably implicated in the activities of modernity is liberated. The importance of

engaging deeply with modernity takes on new meaning and allows integrals to

dispatch with the current reluctance to ‘enable’ it as an inherently destructive

manifestation. Working within modernity takes on a powerful new significance and

normative force. By integrating the shadow of modernity, its ultimate gift to humanity

and its ultimate promise, the light of reason, is liberated to generate its own maturity

as the realization of an integral world.
