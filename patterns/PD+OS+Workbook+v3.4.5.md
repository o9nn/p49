1. Quick Start Guide
How Mass Self-Organisation Changes Everything

                     Self-organisation depends, more than anything else, on
                     developing the quality and richness of our relationships.

It’s as simple as starting there. The great misunderstanding and the great flaw in our currently dominant,
mechanistic world-view is that we should focus on ‘the system’–out there. Too often that’s a distraction from
what really matters and what’s harder to contemplate, but ultimately more rewarding–changing what’s inside
of us so that we are able to change what is between us. Learning to create better relationships is the most
reliable, and some would say the only, way to really change our systems for the better.

Facilitating more widely distributed self-organising capacity must be one of the central strategies for managing
the challenges of an increasingly complex world. At PatternDynamicsTM we can help you develop skills for
doing that. You can get started with this Workbook. But, self-organisation skills are not primarily tools for
‘managing’ groups or organisations (although they can help), they are, first and foremost, an opportunity to
grow by spreading the artistry and science of creating deeper connections.

That is the real reason mass self-organisation changes everything.

The Living Systems View
Living systems work like flocks of birds. They are self-organising: the coordination of the whole
emerges, bottom-up, from the combined interactions of all members of the group. In a living
systems model, individuals make autonomous decisions based on sharing a set of organising
principles. In the case of a flock of birds, they are principles like know the goal, turn when your
neighbour turns, maintain a certain distance to the birds nearby, and follow the bird in front of
you. The parts that make up all living systems, from organisms to whole ecosystems, form
relationships and self-organise in this way.

In contrast to the living systems model, many organisations are based on a mechanistic view. In
mechanistic models, decision making comes from the top down. Individuals are expected to carry
out decisions in a highly structured fashion, like the cogs or springs in a clock. Research indicates
that as organisational challenges become more complex, mechanistic operating models do not
allow sufficient collective input for effective decision making and problem solving. 1

Our goal in this workbook is to provide you with a model that helps you learn principles, practices,
and skills for demonstrating the benefits of increased self-organisation based on a living system
view. By demonstrating these benefits you can attract others to this form of organisational
practice and help lead the change to more generative cultures.

The 7 Principles of Self-Organisation
You can get started very simply. Remember how birds use principles to decide what to do next? You can
do the same thing. Just use the 7 Principles of Self-Organisation below to reflect on your decision making as
challenges arise. Notice that in applying each principle there is an opportunity to develop your relationships.
In the following sections of this Workbook, you will have the opportunity to learn about the principles in
more depth and to apply them as more detailed practices. For now, just imagine that, like a flock of birds,
deciding on adjustments based on these living systems principles will contribute to emergent solutions.

                                                Do your important rhythms and routines feel right? Is there
1) Feel Into Your Rhythms:                   anything that could be more regular, or less?

                                                Have you found all the important sources of information? Who do
2) Locate Important Perspectives:            you need to talk to to locate relevant points of view?

                                                Are key organisational structures represented as simple graphics?
3) Outline Organisational Structures:        How could you update your organisational charts?

                                                How could you learn more by exchanging perspectives? What
4) Coordinate Diverse Perspectives:          priorities may need to be adjusted?

                                                What are some ways you could connect previously unrelated ideas?
5) Design Creative Solutions:                What novel solutions look like the best ones to test?

                                                Are any current goals or milestones outdated? What agreements
6) Reflect on Governance:                    need to be updated to make them more relevant?

                                                Do you sense any changes to your purpose? If so, what adjustments
7) Sense Changes In Your Purpose:            could be made in relation to the principles above?

Ok, But How Does This Actually Work?
You may have noticed that you do many of these things already–intuitively, without really giving it
much thought–and that so do the people around you. Self-Organisation, in the way it is
described here, happens all the time. In any group, everyone makes dozens or even hundreds of
different decisions, big and small, every day that are essential in order for groups to function well.
However, conventional management practices are founded in a mechanistic view, where
individuals are passive elements in the use of top-down control. The reality is that people are
active participants in a living system and that bottom-up influence is, at least, equally important.

This is the essence of the democratic principle–that participation from the base of a hierarchy
matters. PatternDynamics works by empowering effective democratic, bottom-up
participation in groups, communities, and organisations.

It does this in a number of key ways that it is useful to think about as you use the 7 Principles:
- Increases awareness of bottom-up processes by promoting a living systems view.
- Provides a language to identify and communicate about self-organisation clearly.
- Prescribes a simple set of principles to work by and to share.
- Improves collaboration by providing a consistent framework.
- Encourages a set of practical, embeddable practices that build self-organisation skills.
- Designed for getting started quickly and sharing easily.
- Allows individuals to use their own initiative to demonstrate improved self-organisation.
- Promotes a low-risk transformation strategy that’s designed to spread organically.

2. Assess Your Capability
    You’d like to gain skills to help your organisation or community shift to a more open, adaptive,
    innovative self-organising operating model. You understand that the world is becoming more
    complex, and that this is one of the most effective ways to meet the complexity challenge.

    Before we move on to the the PatternDynamicsTM Operating System (PD OS) itself, we’ll start
    with some reflection on the nature of living systems. The questions in the section that follows will
    help you: 1) understand the living systems context, 2) evaluate your existing capability, and 3)
    determine your purpose.

    If you are working on this with a team or a group, feel free to bring them into this process.

  The Living Systems Context
  On the next page, we’ll go through some reflective questions. As well as helping you understand
  more about your group or organisation, this assessment will also help you get a sense of some of the
  important general characteristics of living systems. The characteristics we will focus on are:
  adaptability, innovation, openness, self-organising capacity, and generativity.

  Don’t worry if some of the terms or questions are unfamiliar to you. At PatternDynamics, we have
  developed a range of resources to help people improve their understanding of how living systems
  work. How well you understand them at this point will give you a sense of the strength of your
  existing level of ‘systems thinking’ ability.

Adaptability: How well does your organisation or community mimic a living system’s
capability for solving problems at the level best suited to meet a particular challenge? Contrast
this with the habit of (and/or requirement for) deferring decisions to those higher up the
chain of command.

………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
……………………………………………………………………

Innovation: Describe the degree to which your organisation or community is willing to
experiment with creative solutions. Contrast this with the degree to which existing
processes and structures are relied on to solve emergent challenges.

………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
……………………………………………………………………

Now choose a group or team that you work with directly. Assess the group’s general
performance in relation to the living systems traits below. Then sit down with a colleague and
discuss their views on these topics.

- Openness: How open and inclusive is your group to dissenting, marginal, or outside voices?

………………………………………………………………………………………………
……………………………………………………………………………………

- Self-organisation: How well does this team spontaneously coordinate its activities?

………………………………………………………………………………………………
…………………………………………………………………………………….

- Generativity: How often do people create self-reinforcing cycles that build healthier, more
 functional environments that in turn support the perpetuation of this cycle?

………………………………………………………………………………………………
…………………………………………………………………………………….

How closely did your colleague’s thoughts match your own? What did you learn about your
group’s, and your own, living systems capacity?

Determining Your Purpose
Why do you want to help your team, organisation, or community shift to a more self-
organising operating model? What is your ultimate purpose in facilitating groups that
coordinate themselves using living systems principles?

………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………………………………
………………………………………………………………………….

Reflect for a moment on the impact you could have by adopting more elements of a living
systems operating system. What things could you do regularly, even at a small scale, to
demonstrate the benefits of more open, adaptive, and innovative processes? What
opportunities become available when challenges are met simply and effectively using a more
self-organising approach?

Evaluating Your Current State
Now we’re going to have a look at how you currently perform in your group or organisation. Grade
below, as best you can, quickly and intuitively, how you currently behave in relation to the 7 Principles.
Be honest. Higher scores indicate better self-organisation skills. You can also use this as a ‘360’ type
assessment by asking your colleagues to assess your performances.

   Principle                      Description/Inquiry                                               Score (1–10)

                                   How in touch are you with the important rhythms in your
   Feel Rhythms:                   organisation and when they might need to be adjusted?

                                   How thoroughly do you identify relevant stakeholders and inquire of
   Locate Perspectives:            them their point of view?

                                   How clearly do you represent graphically the structure of roles,
   Outline Structures:             accountabilities, and authorities?

                                   How skilfully do you inquire in order to identify the principles that
   Coordinate Perspectives:        help prioritise diverse perspectives?

                                   How effective are you at making and explaining the creative
   Design Solutions:               connections that lead to better solutions?

                                  How committed are you to setting clear goals and milestones, recording
   Reflect on Governance:         clear agreements, and using these to monitor progress?

                                   How sensitive are you to emerging challenges and to how they may
   Sense Purpose (Source):         require shifts in your original purpose or source inspiration?

                                                                                                  Total
                                                     11
Your Focus
Given your results, which of the 7 Principles would you like to focus on first to improve your
self-organisation skills? Choose more than one if you like. You should still work through the
exercises for each of the 7 Principles in the next section, but deciding what to prioritise will
help you focus your time initially on what’s most relevant for you.

Principles, Patterns and Practices
In order to start using the Operating System (PD OS) itself, you will need to learn more about the 7
Principles by connecting them to their source, the PatternDynamics™ Systems Thinking Framework.

The framework is a set of diagrams or symbols called ‘Patterns’. Each Pattern represents a
comprehensive description of a living systems principle. It’s these principles, based on observations of
natural systems and insights from the systems sciences, that are the origin of the 7 Principles of Self-
Organisation. The Patterns will help you learn more about each of the Principles, when to apply them,
and how. Deepening your recognition and communication of how living systems are organised is one
of the keys to mastery in facilitating self-organisation.

In the Operating System graphic on the previous page, you can see that there is one Pattern associated
with each Principle. In the pages that follow, click on a Pattern to view its full description. If you have a
printed copy of this Workbook you can go to www.patterndynamics.net/patterns to look them up.

To begin using the PD OS you will also need to develop the Principles into a set of Practices–specific
actions you can take to build your skills when faced with decision making and problem solving
challenges.

Below is one page for developing each of the 7 Practices. On each page you will find an Overview, 3
Elements of each Practice, its associated Pattern, and an Exercise. Learn, undertake, and reflect on
these regularly. You should get benefits as you are practicing each one, but it is when you learn to
integrate them into an ongoing adaptive process that you will get the best results.

                                                    14
Feel Rhythms
Get in touch with timing. Having effective routines and cycles is required for optimising the organisation of any
group. However, regularity should not be seen as fixed, or an end in itself–rhythms should be adjusted for
both regularity and flexibility as required. The practice of Feeling Rhythms has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Sense Cycles: develop an awareness of repetitions, pulses, swings, and other regularities over time.

- Introduce Routines: introduce regularity into activities when required.

- Adjust Rhythms: find the optimum balance between regularity and flexibility as circumstances change.

Pattern:                     Rhythm is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with the
                             practice of Feeling Rhythms. It reminds us that balancing regularity with flexibility
                             within a system is important for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Feeling Rhythms is an embodied skill that requires the ability to sense tensions in relation to timing. Try this
exercise a few times in the coming weeks: Notice when you are feeling either emotionally frustrated or
excited about the timing of a group process. Where does this emotion show up in your body? Write down
what you think needs to be adjusted and why. How could you increase your sensitivity to both challenges
and opportunities in relation to synchronising events better in time?

                                                        15
Locate Perspectives
Engage all relevant points of view. Identifying the important stakeholders is essential for accessing all the
information required to meet challenges effectively. Importantly, you must seek to verify any assumptions

### made about the information they hold. Locating Perspectives has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Identify Stakeholders: confirm all important stakeholders and sources of information.

- Take Perspectives: prioritise sources and imagine the information they possess.

- Seek Perspectives: engage directly with sources to verify available information.

Pattern:                    Polarity is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with the
                            practice of Locating Perspectives. It reminds us that identifying all the important
                            distinctions (relevant elements) that stand out from the general background is
                            important for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Locating Perspectives is a perspectival skill that requires the ability to locate distinct points of view, to imagine
what they could tells us, and to verify what they actually do tell us. Try this exercise 3 times. Think about a
challenge you are facing and list three important stakeholders. Try to choose people who have a wide range
of roles in relation to this situation. Imagine what each of them thinks. What happens when you seek to verify
what they think? Did you guess accurately? If so, how accurately? If not, how different were your guesses?

                                                         16
Outline Structures
Draw organisational structures. Graphically representing your organisational architecture brings clarity to roles,
accountabilities, relationships, and structures. However, it is important to also document where agreed-on

### authority lies. Outlining Structures has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- List Roles and Accountabilities: record and clarify required roles and their responsibilities.

- Clarify Authorities: verify the nature and scope of the agreed-on authority assigned to each role.

- Draw Structures: create simple, graphic representations of relationships, roles and authorities.

Pattern:                     Structure is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with
                             Outlining Structures. It reminds us that a clear understanding of a system’s
                             structure is important for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Outlining Structures is a graphic skill that requires the ability to represent organisational architectures,
primarily with non-verbal symbols. Try this exercise for three organisations or communities: Use small circles
to represent individuals. Use different sized circles to represent different sized groups. Nest circles to show
where they are parts of a bigger group. Show relationships by locating circles together or by using connecting
lines. Label with words to describe roles and authorities. How is the information contained in your diagrams
different from purely written descriptions of the same structures?

                                                        17
Coordinate Perspectives
Use systems thinking to collaborate. Coordinating views, through inquiring to identify principles that locate
common ground, minimises conflict and optimises cooperation. This process requires the ability to think well
and communicate effectively about the wider system. Coordinating Perspectives has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Collaborate through Inquiry: use inquiring conversations to build trust and exchange information.

- Use Systems Thinking: think about the wider context and identify principles that unify perspectives.

- Coordinate Perspectives: seek agreement regarding important principles and priorities.

Pattern:                     Exchange is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with
                             Coordinating Perspectives. It reminds us that exchanging information and
                             identifying common principles is required for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Coordinating Perspectives is a relational skill that requires the ability to communicate effectively, build trust,
identify common themes, and facilitate agreement. Try this exercise three times: Identify a challenge. Ask three
people their views on meeting this challenge. Listen only and record. Review your records and try to identify
common themes and principles. Hint: The ultimate purpose of a group should always be one such theme.
How does searching for the common ground change the way you perceive a situation?

                                                        18
Design Decisions
Make creative connections for design solutions. More effective problem solving requires the creative association
and organisation of previously unconnected ideas. However, proposed solutions can only be optimised if you
are able to explain the reasoning behind your choices. Designing Decisions has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Connect Ideas: link your most important ideas to create novel solution prototypes.

- Design Solutions: integrate ideas from prototypes to create and decide on a solution to test.

- Explain Rationale: explain the reasons behind your decision making process.

Pattern:                     Creativity is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with
                             Designing Decisions. It reminds us that making creative connections is important
                             for building self-organising capacity.
              Creativity

### Exercise:

Designing Decisions is a design skill. It requires the ability to select important elements and themes related to
a challenge, connect them in new ways, create well-designed solutions, and explain your thinking. Try this
exercise. Seek multiple perspectives to identify important elements of a challenge. Group like elements into
themes. See how many creative connections you can make between elements and themes. List three new
ideas that emerge from this process. Has this changed how you think about making decisions? If so, how?

                                                        19
Govern Reflectively
Review agreements to govern. Self-organising governance is facilitated by collaborating to establish goals and
milestones and recording them in transparent agreements. However, governance is optimised only if all
parties reflect on these agreements regularly and modify them as required. Reflective Governing has three

### elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Set Milestones: co-create agreed on goals and milestones.

- Record Agreements: record roles, accountabilities, tasks and authorities in transparent agreements.

- Review Progress: reflect regularly on progress and modifying agreements as required.

Pattern:                     Dynamics is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with
                             Governing Reflectively. It reminds us that practicing dynamic steering through
                             reflective leadership is important for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Governing Reflectively is a leadership skill that requires the ability to encourage ongoing, collaborative co-
creation and reflection in relation to goals, milestones, and agreements. Do this exercise in relation to three
agreements you currently have in place, whether they are explicitly recorded or not. Reflect on what has
changed since progress started toward the latest milestones. Have these changes affected your goal? Does
your agreement need to be modified to get the best outcome?

                                                       20
Source Sensing
Maintain awareness of evolving purpose. Having a clear shared purpose is a powerful source of self-organising
capacity. However, your purpose will shift and evolve as different challenges help to identify new goals and

### directions. Source Sensing has three elements:

### Practice Elements:

- Connect to Source: maintain an awareness of the origin and evolution of your purpose and goals.

- Sense Tensions: develop the capacity to sense information pointing to opportunities for change.

- Adjust the System: becoming skilled at sensing when and how to make adjustments.

Pattern:                     Source is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with
                             Source Sensing. It reminds us that being sensitive to emergent challenges and
                             opportunities for change is important for building self-organising capacity.

### Exercise:

Source Sensing is an intuitive skill that requires present awareness of sensations, perceptions, emotions, ideas,
and narratives. Do this exercise during group discussions. Focus on being relaxed, present, and aware. Make
your breathing deep, regular, and slow. What are the subtler kinds of stimuli that you aware of? Try and
connect them to tensions in the group that might signal a need for change?

Run the Operating System
Ok, you’ve got a sense of the living systems view, learned some Principles, been introduced to a set of Patterns, and
started to develop some deeper Practices. Now it’s time to take your skill building to the next level and integrate
everything you’ve learned.

We’re going to start with a step by step process, but as you become more practiced, you’ll be able to use the PD
OS more intuitively. As you head toward mastery, it will serve more as a set of touchstones, enabling your own more
spontaneous and fluid interpretations. Even at this stage, though, its a good idea to keep the OS handy as a reference.

Pick a group challenge and work your way through the Health Check Card on page 26. Use
the PD Operating Model on a Page, below, as a reference guide and follow the cycle. The performance indicators

### are:

- Low Performance: where the practice is virtually non existent, poorly understood, and not getting results.
- Medium Performance: where it’s sometimes used, only partially understood, and getting only limited results.
- High Performance: where it’s fully integrated, understood by everyone, and getting optimal results.

Continue with repeated cycles of the OS. Work towards high performance (3 points) in each box. Using the Health
Check Chart and following the steps in the OS cycle are a great way to get started, but they’re a bit like training
wheels–when you’re ready, you’ll want to move beyond them to enjoy a more free flowing experience.

The difference between the PD OS and other more distributed or networked organisational operating systems is
that its not primarily a system–it’s a practice. Your colleagues won’t necessarily know about your practice, and if they
do, or if others are practicing with you, no one will have to face the disruptions of conforming to a new system.
They should just enjoy the benefits as your practice builds better relationships and enhances the group’s natural
capacity for self-organisation.

The Source Course
The Source Course is a simple exercise that will help you, and others, learn to deepen your understanding
of this foundational Principle of Self-Organisation. It will also demonstrate how to think about finding the
optimal balance for any principle you are working with, in any context.

Source represents a shared primary ethic of fostering generative health.

Its power lies in the fact that generating health–living systems’ unrelenting drive to create the conditions
that will support healthier, more enduring living systems–is the deepest inclination of a self-organising
universe.

Not only is Source the central organising principle of PatternDynamics itself, it can act as a guiding star for
self-organising activity within any group, community, or organisation.

As you will see, to work with Source we need to balance three primary principles of systems health:

- the balance between parts (individuals) and the whole (the collective)
- the balance between tangible results and intangible value
- the balance between short term outcomes and long term viability

Follow the instructions on the next page. You can also print and distribute the Source Course pages and
do this as a group exercise.

Finding the Balance
In the Source Course, you practiced reflecting on the balance of each of Source’s three principles.
Learning to recognise the balance represented by a point of view, in relation to a range of different
principles of organisation, is a key to attaining mastery in applying the living systems view.
To continue to develop your practice, see if you can identify how different perspectives are
balanced in relation to the Principles represented by the other Patterns in the PD Framework. Click
on the ones below for descriptions. Place marks on the sliders until you can sense the balance
intuitively, without this supporting activity.

### Next Steps:

You may have noticed that the OS acts as a virtuous cycle of practice. The more cycling you do, the
more you gain the benefits of an increasingly adaptive, open and innovative operating model, which
encourages more practice–and on it goes. To get support with your virtuous cycling, and to learn
more Patterns and Principles click here and join the PD forum training community:
