                          The Challenge: Complexity
- Over 20 years working as a leader in sustainability
    initiatives.
- I struggled for years because I didn’t have tools for making
    eﬀective changes to complex systems.
- Then I discovered the power of collaborative systems
    thinking and developed the PatternDynamics™ framework.
- Now I have reliable method for working more eﬀectively
    with complex challenges.
- It is substantiated by high quality research.
- It is very practical and I can introduce it to others.
- I no longer feel isolated because now I have a way
              of communicating my systems perspective.

                                                                       w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t

Learning Outcomes
 There are three levels of skill attainment at each level of PatternDynamics™ Training
- Familiarity: Where you can identify the relevant Patterns in your life, work, and world with

          reference to learning materials or support from more advanced practitioners.
- Competency: Where you can identify the relevant Patterns consistently in most situations

          without reference to learning materials or others.
- Fluency: Where you can identify and prioritise the level of importance of relevant Patterns

          consistently in all situations without reference or support, and communicate about your
          perspective eﬀectively to diﬀerent people in diﬀerent contexts.

### This learning resource is designed to support the attainment of:

- Competency in the use of the Source Pattern and its three dimensions.

- Familiarity with the other 6 First Order Patters: Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange,

          Creativity, and Dynamics.

                                                                                    w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t
Learning Method
 Learning to think holistically about the dynamic patterns of organisation in systems requires a diﬀerent type of learning practice.
 This is diﬀerent to how we usually learn about the parts of those systems. In PatternDynamics™ training you will notice:
- a lot of repetition.
- a very similar pattern of explanation in each Pattern module.
- multiple closely related examples and ways of exploring each Pattern.
 The reason for this is that learning to ‘see’ patterns of organisation in systems requires that we look at each one from multiple
 perspectives, in multiple contexts, and in a repeated fashion. The diﬀerent types of learning content and practices that support

### this approach include:

- written material
- videos
- graphic symbols and charts
- exercises to practice in everyday life and work
- examples of Patterns in diﬀerent contexts
- embodies exercises that include movement and group practice

                                                                                                      w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t
Learning Design
The PatternDynamics™ learning system (learning praxis) is designed to start simply and to build
step by step towards more complex skills and understandings.
- Introduction: The Source Course
- We get started by learning about Source, the most central Pattern in the
                                                                                                                   Part                      Whole
                   PatternDynamics™ system, and how to apply it simply and easily to get immediate
                                                                                                                  Short                      Long Term
                   results in your own life.                                                                    Tangible                     Intangible

### •   Level 1:

- Then we move on to learn the other 6 First Order Patters, which form Aspects of
                   Source. This provides a foundation for systems thinking skills and applications.

### •   Level 2:

- Next we learn the 49 Second Order Patterns and how to use them as an integrated
                   system for more advanced systems thinking and to help others learn introductory
                   PatternDynamics™ skills.

### •   Level 3:

- The final stage helps practitioners to use the total system of 56 Patterns, to craft their
                   application eﬀectively for diﬀerent contexts, and to use them fluently to support the
                   development of systems thinking skills in others such as decision making and complex
                   problem solving.

                                                                                                                     w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t

### The Source Course:

         Getting Started with PatternDynamics™

### Principle:

                                                 “Source Code”: the collective awareness
                                                 of identity and purpose.
- the most central and important
                                                         source of any system’s self-

                             Recommendations
- Get in the habit of trying to identify the purpose (Source) of issues that

 arise in your life and work.
- Regularly evaluate the eﬀects of how you and others are thinking about

 these issues in terms of the three dimensions of Source.
- Draw the Source Pattern on a piece of paper or a white board and

### place the three sliders under it. Label them:

                                                                                  Part                             Whole
- Part/Whole

- Short Term/Long Term                                      Short Term                                Long Term

- Tangible/Intangible                                            Tangible                             Intangible

- Mark where you think your perspective lies on each slider. Make this a

 regular habit and reflect on how it changes your thinking about issues that
 arise and your ability to communicate how you feel about them.
- Reflection through journalling, blogging, or other writing will be

        particularly eﬀective.

       PatternDynamics™ Decision Making Practice
Learning the meaning of the Patterns provides the central content of PatternDynamics™ applications. There are
multiple possibilities for the application of PatternDynamics™ content. Two foundation applications are to
decision making and complex problem solving. Applications like this form the process components of
PatternDynamics™ practice. We will progressively outline the initial components of the PatternDynamics™

### Decision Making methodology below:

- Perspective Mapping

- The practice of identifying the Patterns in relation to diﬀerent
             perspectives on issues and evaluating where they fall on a
             continuum of their expression.
- For instance this is what you are doing when you use the Source             Part                             Whole

             Course practice. Although we did not make it explicit in the           Short Term                            Long Term
                                                                                      Tangible                            Intangible
             course, what you are actually doing when you place markers on
             the sliders is mapping a perspective by identifying it and drawing a
             representation (or a map) of how it is expressed.

                                                                                                 w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t
     PatternDynamics™ Decision Making Practice

Decision Making Step 1
- Source Tracking

- Checking to see if the issue is related strongly enough to the ultimate purpose or Source of your

             group or organisation to merit continued decision making eﬀort.
- Perspective Mapping

- Perspective Coordination

- Undertaking reflective thinking or conversations about mapped perspectives (points of view)
             with an attitude of curiosity and inquiry in order to discover what each perspective is
             contributing to a more wholistic picture.

                                                                                           w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t

Decision Making Step 2
- Tension Sensing

- Becoming skilled at sensing when an important issue is emerging in an unfolding situation.

- Can be sensed using our bodily sensations, emotional states, mental activity, and

                    intuition.
- Source Tracking

- Perspective Mapping

- Perspective Coordination

- Systems Thinking

- Using the 7 First Order Patters in the PatternDynamics™ Framework to identify multiple

              patterns of organisation in a given situation and then use these perspectives as additional
              perspectives to coordinate.

         The Origin of Order

‘Source’ represents the ‘drive to thrive’.

                                             w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t
‘Source’ represents the ‘drive to thrive’
In the PatternDynamics™ framework Source is the foundational, universal pattern of self-
organisation at the heart of all systems.

Each and every system in the universe is a unique expression of Source.

More specifically Source signifies the quality of the collective awareness of the expression of
a given system’s unique identity and purpose–or what could be thought of as the ongoing
evolution of its ‘source code’–and how that awareness affects the strength of its self-
organising capacity.

When awareness of a system’s identity and purpose is co-created, widespread, clear, and
present, the parts of that system can better identify and commit to aligned roles that
strengthen that system’s core self-organising pattern, or Source.

All systems in nature have clear patterns that form the same atoms, molecules and cells into
different dynamic, self-organising entities. For instance, biological systems as diverse as various
types of plants, animals, and even whole ecosystems all have distinct identities and roles that
evolve over time to adapt successfully to changing circumstances.

                                                                                         w w w. p a t t e r n d y n a m i c s . n e t
- How does the evolution of a system’s role or purpose affect the organization of the parts
 of that system?

- Think about what it means when an organization makes changes to its source code– its
 core identity and purpose, and therefor its role within the greater scheme of things.

- How does this affect the awareness of what the organization is, who it attracts, and their
 level of commitment? If it is a radical change, will members still identify strongly enough
 with the organisation to participate fully and effectively?

- Will its clients and suppliers?

- If an organization does not change at all, will it remain relevant as things change around
 it?

- Have you been part of a group response to an emergency?

- What was the strength of the collective awareness of the identity and purpose of that
 group?

- How did it affect self-organizing capacity?

- How could you balance Source or integrate it more fully into a system in your life to
 improve how it is organized?

Description
Significance: The Source Pattern represents the quality
of the collective awareness of the ongoing evolution
that forms a system’s essential nature, or source code.

Role: The role of Source is to serve as the core collective
inquiry process that generates awareness of the

### ongoing expressions of a system’s essential nature:

“What is the origin and evolution our identity and
purpose?”
Effect: Source demonstrates the power of collective
inquiry to generate awareness that strengthens the self-
organising drive all systems have to co-create the
conditions that allow them to thrive.
Balance: Source must be balanced so that, on the one
hand, a strong connection is maintained to the origin of
a system’s identity and purpose; but, on the other hand,
an strong inquiry is maintained that allows that same
identity and purpose to evolve in a way that helps it
thrive under changing circumstances.

Pattern
The Source Pattern signifies the three primordial dimensions of
Source as an ongoing inquiry.

- The Part and the Whole: The two inner shapes denote ‘parts’
   that are encompassed by the larger oval into a ‘whole’
   system.
     o “What is the effect on the part vs the whole?”

- The Short Term and the Long Term: The figure of eight shape
   represents the infinity of the unfolding of time while the
   encompassing oval signifies the shorter cycles within it.
     o “What is the effect on the short term vs the long term?”

- The Tangible and the Intangible: The lines of the Pattern
   represent the easily seen, tangible aspects of systems while the
   white spaces in and around the lines signify the less tangible
   spaces that defines them.
     o “What is the effect on the tangible vs the intangible?”

Examples
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere

Organism: The first complex (eukaryotic) cells evolved
as a new pattern of organization of already existing
simpler (prokaryotic) cells and bacteria. The purpose of
this new symbiosis was to create a system in which
each of the elements does better as part of the system
than as a lone individual. Within the identity of the
eukaryotic cell some of the bacteria adapted to
become the power plants (mitochondria) and some
adapted to become organelles that capture sunlight
and convert it into chemical energy (chloroplasts).

Inquiry: How did the co-creation of the eukaryotic cell
system help create the conditions for its elements to
thrive? Did this evolution of the cell pattern contribute to
the greater ability of the biosphere, as a whole, to thrive
and evolve?

Examples
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere

Ecosystem: Lichen colonies are formed through a
symbiotic relationship between fungi and green algae.
Both a fungus and an alga have different patterns of
organisation as independent organisms. When in
relationship their joint form is distinct and identifiable as a
lichen. Through the symbiotic organisation of the lichen
form they are able to colonize harsh environments like
desert where they exude compounds that stabilize the
shifting sands so seeds of higher plants can germinate. If
conditions are suitable the’ parts’ of the lichen system may
revert to their original identities as fungi and algae
respectively.

Inquiry: How does the co-creation of the lichen pattern of
organization create the conditions for other organisms to
build a more complex ecological system?

Examples
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems

Organizations: The clear identity and purpose of an organic
farming operation is to farm without harmful chemicals so
that it may provide healthy food, nurture healthy soils, and
sustain ecosystems. Its clear identity and purpose and its
suitability for repairing degraded environmental conditions
has assisted organics to become one of the fastest growing
industries on the planet.

Inquiry: Has the identity and purpose of the organics industry
evolved since its inception? If so how has this affected
different types of consumers in the organics industry?

Examples
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems

Socio-Economic Systems: A community credit union lends
money to and takes deposits from local people and
businesses only, clearly contrasting it with the identity and
purpose of commercial banks which operate a much
wider range of financial services over much larger
geographical areas. The dilution of larger banking
institutions’ identities and purposes as they diversified into
insurance and the brokering of financial derivatives has
fuelled their short term growth, but may have made them
unstable, undermining their long term viability.

Inquiry: Is there a relationship between the radical changes
in the identity and purpose of some larger banking
institutions and the behaviour by individuals within them that
has destabilized them?

‘Rhythm’ represents the waves and cycles of a system.
All natural systems have regular repetitions and cycles that order events over time. The most
important ecological cycle is the annual changing of the seasons caused by the tilt in the
earth’s axis relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. The moon causes ocean tides to
ebb and flow with a complex monthly rhythm. This rhythm is in turn overlaid with the pulse of
waves caused by the wind. Both the seasons and the tides coordinate biological activities,
fertility cycles, resource pulses, and a host of other natural rhythms.

- What role do rhythms play within a system?

- Think about how having holidays at irregular and random times from year to year would
 affect the organization of your workplace.

- What would happen if there was never any variation to the routine?

- Does your household function better when your family’s weekly routine is regular and
 uninterrupted?

- How could you balance an existing Rhythm or integrate a new one into a system in your
 life to improve how it is organized?

- How do rhythms serve to coordinate systems?

Description
Significance: The Rhythm Pattern represents the
repetitions, swings, pulses, synchronizations and other
regularities of processes that characterize a system’s
unfolding in time.

Role: The role of Rhythm is to coordinate elements and
events in time.

Effect: Rhythm demonstrates the effectiveness of
regular patterns in time that assist elements of a system
to engage in coordinated processes.

Balance: Rhythms must be balanced so that, on the
one hand, their regularity does not become fixed, which
may cause problems if conditions require change; or, on
the other hand, change too often or too quickly, which
can pose unnecessary or costly adaptive challenges for
the rest of the system.

Organism: All life forms have rhythms of activity that vary in
order to support the health of that organism. Respiration in
animals is a good example of a Rhythm that serves to
coordinate the activity of the entire organism in order to
keep it healthy. If the Rhythm of respiration is too slow the
animal will not have enough oxygen to drive metabolic
processes, but if it is too fast it may cause hyperventilation –
the loss of too much carbon dioxide from the blood and a
resultant loss of blood pressure.

Inquiry: What would happen to an organism that was being
pursued by a predator if it did not increase its rate of
respiration as it increased its physical activity to escape?

Ecosystem: Humans have intervened in natural forest fire
cycles by introducing smaller, but more frequent fires. This
keeps the fuel load from building up to the point where
there are large, but infrequent, hot fires that may destroy
property. Changing the Rhythm of fire frequency has other
wider effects on the ecosystem, including changing species
composition of both plants and animals, altering soil
conditions and changing predator/prey relationships.
Inquiry: If fire Rhythms are changed from erratic natural fire
frequencies and sizes to more regular and smaller burns
managed by humans, could this change the amount of
total soil carbon?

Organizations: Businesses have financial reporting cycles
that influence rhythms within the business like capital
expenditures, investment strategies, and wage level
adjustments. In most cases annual reporting is sufficient,
but if a business is undergoing a period of rapid growth or
change it may be necessary to do more frequent financial
analysis in order to keep the business healthy.

conditions remain the same, but it diminishes the regularity
of its financial reporting?

Socio-Economic Systems: All scales of financial economies
throughout history have displayed extremities and
irregularities in their levels of activity that have posed
challenges for the sustainability of those economies. This is
referred to as a ‘boom and bust‘ dynamic. Governments
and financial institutions regularly intervene to try and
moderate extreme swings in financial activities and to
introduce more reliability into the rhythms of financial
markets.

Inquiry: Is it possible to mitigate the extremities of the boom

‘Polarity’ represents the relationship between opposites.
All natural systems have opposing elements and dynamics that are really just two sides of one
thing. Growth and decay in biological systems are two interdependent aspects of the cycle
of life. Although they seem like opposing processes, one cannot exist without the other. They
are necessary compliments.

- What role do polarities play within systems?

- Think about what your workplace would be like if everyone spent all their time
 communicating and no time actually acting to get things done.

- Think also about the opposite scenario where only action was prioritized and no one
 communicated to anyone else.

- How does the more masculine drive to get things done interact with the more feminine
 tendency to discuss how that should happen?

- Does an organisation that needs to make a big decision about its future direction need to
 prioritize a more masculine or a more feminine approach?

- How could you balance an existing Polarity or integrate a new one into a system in your life
 to improve it?

- How do polarities serve to coordinate systems?

integrated to take advantage of both approaches,
but, on the other hand, they must also be maintained
to build potential.

Organism: All organisms must balance the relationship
between inputs to their system and the outputs from
their system. If an organism is growing then its inputs of
nutrients need to exceed its output of wastes. If
conditions change in the environment and nutrients for
that organism become scarce it must then adjust so
that outputs exceed inputs, allowing it to shrink and
survive.

in a growth mode with high inputs as resources become
scarcer?

is a major planetary regulator of oxygen levels, and by
extension the maintenance of atmospheric conditions

levels become high then less fire adapted ecosystems will
ignite. If boreal forests were to continue to burn when
oxygen levels are low some organisms may struggle to
respire.

hyper-individualism and social breakdown. Cooperation
creates synergies, but unless it is integrated with competition
it leads to a loss of drive by high performing individuals

‘Structure’ represents bones of the system.
All natural systems have frameworks that provide relatively fixed and unchanging support
structures for more dynamic aspects of the system. Forests are based on the tall, enduring
biological structure of trees. Higher animals have strong bone skeletons and lower animals
like insects have rigid exoskeletons. Even relatively soft biological cells have cytoskeletons
that maintain their structural integrity.

- What role do structures play within a system?

- Think about what an organization would be like if its legal frameworks changed frequently
 or were removed altogether.

- Think also about what it would be like if these legal frameworks never changed and
 remained the same now as they were hundreds of years ago.

- How do unwritten, but well understood, codes of behaviour provide stability within
 families?

- When do these sorts of structures start to cause problems?

 life to improve how it is organized?

Organism: All higher animals have interior structural
frameworks called skeletons. Their job is to provide
support for the rest of the components of the body. If
the bones of a creature’s skeleton become too brittle
and lose all flexibility, they may break too easily. If
bones are too flexible and soft they will not be able to
support the weight of the other elements of the body.

are not changed at all over time, they may become
irrelevant in an evolving economy.

‘Exchange’ signifies the productive capacity of systems.
All natural systems have productive processes driven by specialized elements exchanging energy and
materials with each other. Flowers distribute nectar as a natural energy product in an exchange with
insects and animals that do the work of distributing the plant’s pollen. This is a more efficient and
therefore more productive outcome than if the flower had to organize its own pollination and the insects
and animals had to photosynthesize their own sugars from sunlight energy.

- What role do exchanges play within a system?

- Think about what an organisation would be like if it did not have a unique role within the economy that
 allowed it to create products or services competitively so as to become a desirable trading partner.

- What would a business be like that tried to be an extreme generalist and work in a multitude of
 unrelated industries?

- Alternatively, what would it be like to be so highly specialized that your role was only infrequently
 required within an organisation?

- How do you choose the appropriate level of specialization? How does trade amongst specialists make
 everybody better off?

Organism: The major organs, which act as sub systems

### within animals’ bodies, specialize in unique capacities:

hormone regulation by the endocrine system, filtration
by the kidneys, pumping blood by the heart, and
gaseous interchange by the lungs–to name but a few.
Organs have evolved specializations that allow them to
enter into relational exchanges as part of a greater
system, but many are not so highly specialized that they
cannot cover off the function of other organs. For
instance the kidneys and heart have secondary
endocrine functions supporting hormone regulation in
the body.

Inquiry: What purpose does it serve to have something
like endocrine function covered by more than one
element in the body?

Ecosystem: Specialized fungi translocate mineral elements
through the soil and deliver them to the roots of plants
where they are exchanged for sugars produced in the
plant’s leaves. If a fungus specializes to the degree where
it can exchange with only one species of plant it may
become very efficient, but if its plant partner disappears so
will the fungus. If the fungus is less specialized and has a
generalized capacity to trade with many species it may
not be maximally efficient, but it will be more resilient to
changes in plant distributions.

Inquiry: What would happen to a pollinating insect that
specialized in pollinating only one particular kind of plant if
that plant became endangered?

Organizations: Specialist employees exchange skills like
accounting, management, trade skills, and IT expertise in
order to create productive business systems. If the
employees are so highly specialized that they do not
understand enough about other roles within the business
to relate to them, or in a pinch fill in for them, then
specialization may have gone too far. If employees and
managers are too general in their abilities, tasks may be
covered off by a number of people, but they will not be
done with maximum levels of expertise or productivity.

Inquiry: In different kinds of organization is it appropriate to
have differing levels of the degree to which people
specialize in their skills? If so, why?

Socio-Economic Systems: Economies are composed of
individuals, businesses and whole industries that develop
unique capacities and then trade to form a multi-scaled
system of exchange. Highly specialized businesses and
institutions are needed as economies grow more complex,
but high specialization makes business vulnerable to
market changes that marginalize the demand for their
unique goods or services. All businesses in an economic
system must find the balance between high specialization
that brings productivity gains and more general capacities
that allow them to adapt to changing circumstances.

Inquiry: In a period of volatile and uncertain market
conditions should a business increase its specialization to
drive productivity or increase its adaptive ability by investing
in the ability to produce a more flexible range of products?

‘Creativity’ represents the emergence of new forms within a system.
All natural systems display the capacity for creative evolution in response to changes in
the conditions around them. Animals that camouflage themselves to mimic their
environment must evolve their strategies as the landscape around them changes. Plant
species will continually evolve new forms of protection as their predators evolve to
overcome previous protective strategies.

- What role does creativity play within a system?

- Think about what it would be like if an organization was constantly reinventing itself.

- Would it have enough periods of stable activity to be productive?

- Alternatively, what if an organization never changed any aspect of how it was
 organised?

- How much energy does it take to create a new recipe versus using one you already
 know well?

- How could you balance an existing Creativity process or integrate a new one into a
 system in your life to improve how it is organized?

Significance: The Creativity Pattern represents the
emergence of new forms and processes within systems.
Role: The role of Creativity is to help systems adapt to
changes in the ever-changing environments around
them.
Effect: Creativity demonstrates the large gains that can
be made through successful innovation.
Balance: Creativity must be balanced so that, on the
one hand, a system gains the benefits of successful
innovation; but, on the other hand, it does not become
exhausted through continually expending energy on
uncertain experiments.

Organism: Organisms as diverse as viruses and
mammals show both minor adaptations to temporary
changes in things like moisture availability and major
evolutionary leaps to accommodate greater changed
circumstances, such as climate change. Any organism
that places a large emphasis on experimental
adaptations risks expending too much energy
innovating. This will compromise existing productivity.
On the other hand, organisms that do not adapt at all,
or too slowly, will be out-competed by organisms that
adapt to fit the changing circumstances better.

Inquiry: Even if outside circumstances do not change
could an organism be outcompeted in its niche if
another organism innovates in a way that makes it more
productive in that niche?

Ecosystem: Forest ecosystems display adaptive responses
that allow them to recover from disturbances as diverse as
wind throw, landslip, human harvesting, pest infestation,
and fire. If conditions like human harvesting place a
greater imperative to adapt to disturbance than the forest
can manage, it may be replaced by another vegetation
type more suited to that type of disturbance. Alternatively,
if forest ecosystems are protected by humans from the
cycles of disturbance to which they have adapted, like
fire, they may lose their natural vigour and become prone
to attack by things they are not adapted to, like pests and
disease normally held in check by fire events.

Inquiry: Is it important to recognize what types of
disturbance events ecosystems have adapted to when
managing them? If so, why?

Organizations: All organisations must balance the rate of
change to their operational systems. If changes are made
too frequently and speculatively the energy spent by
members adapting to the new changes and the energy
required to repair failures may compromise the health of
the organisation. If changes are not made frequently
enough the organisation may become dysfunctional by
virtue of being out of step with the world around it.

Inquiry: Do competitors assess other organisations’ levels of
adaptation to current conditions? Why is this an important
consideration in a competitive environment?

Socio-Economic Systems: If governments make large or
frequent changes to tax law without consulting industry
and without giving enough notice of changes, business
may find it difficult and resource intensive to adapt to the
new fiscal conditions. If government regulators are slow to
change tax law to fit with changed economic conditions
then it may have an equally disruptive effect because tax
revenue may not be being collected effectively enough to
support the institutions required for a robust economy.
Inquiry: Can you think of an example where changes to tax
law made it very difficult for some business to adapt quickly
enough to survive?

‘Dynamics’ signifies the coordination of processes at the systems level.
All natural systems have processes that integrate dynamics at the systems level. In terrestrial ecosystems
fire events can cause changes in species composition that favor more future fire events, starting a positive
feedback loop that amplifies fire frequency. Small adjustments over many iterative cycles can lead
systems to adapt considerably over time to events like climate change or soil fertility decreases.

- What role do systems dynamics play within systems?

- Think about what it would be like within an organization if there was no way for feedback to be given or

 received by anyone.

- How would this aﬀect the ability to adjust operations to suit new conditions?

- How does feedback operate to either enhance or diminish a process within a system?

- What eﬀect does making small changes over many cycles have versus making a dramatic change over a

 relatively short period of time?

Organism: The human nervous system is constantly
taking measurements of ambient temperature, which
then feed back to adjust activity levels and the body’s
overall metabolic rate. If the iteration period of cycles
of adjustment is left too long the system will swing wildly
from extreme to extreme. If the cycles are too frequent
the system will become stressed from the constant
activity of adjustment.

Inquiry: What would happen if the body’s ability to
measure ambient temperature was faulty and it

temperatures rose?

Ecosystem: Coral Reefs are formed by a symbiotic
relationship between a calcium carbonate secreting polyp
and a photosynthetic algae, which lives within its tissues.
This dynamic synergy allows these tiny creatures to build
vast reef systems. If the individual organisms give up too
much autonomy the reef system will lose adaptability. If
the different organisms do not cooperate fully enough a
reef system will not be possible.

Inquiry: How does the level of integration at the level of the

Organizations: Incremental adjustments to a business’s
core operating system over many cycles may help
improve organisational performance. If the adjustments to
the system in each iteration are too large, too much
energy is used up in making adjustments and not enough is
available for productive activity. If the adjustments are
smaller the organisation may be more stable, but lose
market share over time as competitors evolve more
rapidly.
