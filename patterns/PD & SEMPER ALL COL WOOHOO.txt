As the world becomes more complex, social and organisational challenges can no longer be met using outdated, simplistic traditional structures. 
 
Dealing with the complexity challenge requires a sustainable transition to a more sophisticated, adaptive, Living Systems Operating Model.

Why PD ? 
www.patterndynamics.net  
 
 
Many alternative operating models require: 
 
• mass uptake to become e.ective 

• big structural changes that are di.cult to complete 

• overly disruptive interventions that often impede e.ectiveness 

• high stakes reorganisations that pose a risk of chaotic breakdown 


 
A better approach is a sustainable transition to a more suitable operating model.

PatternDynamics™ Source Course 
Explanation: Source is related to your ultimate purpose as an organization. When it is co-created, widespread, clear, and present it forms a central organizing principle of that system. This 'course on a page' is designed to get you up and running with a powerful system thinking principle that will help you coordinate perspectives. Evaluating perspectives in this way will help you generate new insights for better decision making. 
Instructions: Choose a topic or issue that is important to you, record it below, and read the descriptions of the three dimensions of Source. See if you can place an 'X' on each slider bar that indicates how you (or another) is thinking about this issue.

Part/Whole: All systems are composed of a series of parts that come together to form an integrated whole. Does your thinking (or another's) relate more strongly to outcomes for a part of your organization or more to results for the organization as a whole? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Part/Whole slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities. 
Short Term/Long Term: To function optimally all systems must balance achieving short term outcomes with long term goals. Does your thinking (or another's) relate more strongly to achieving short term outcomes or more to working towards long term aims and objectives? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Short Term/Long Term slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities. 
 
Tangible/Intangible: All systems require the creation and maintenance of both tangible value that can be objectively measured (like .nancial outcomes) and more intangible value that tends to be evaluated subjectively (like the quality of relationships or the level of trust). Does your thinking on this issue (or another's) relate more strongly to creating tangible value for the organization or relate more to creating intangible value? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Tangible/Intangible slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities.

Rationale Support Framework 
Argumentation (rationale) is how you explain the reasoning behind your decision in a coherent, convincing, and authoritative manner. Doing this increases your in.uence as a decision maker and leader. 
 
Below is a framework that will help you support your argumentation based on the decision making skills you have learned in this practice. 
 
 
 
Tension Sensing: I sensed an informative tension related to (this issue/topic)   
 
in myself and/or others by observing these sensations/emotions/re.ections/intuitions… 

Source Tracking: This issue/topic relates back to the ultimate purpose of our organization through the following pathway… 

Perspective Taking: I identi.ed the following stakeholder perspectives as important for a good understanding of this issue/topic and I imagined what they thought as follows… 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
Perspective Seeking: Given the limited time and resources available for making this decision I chose to directly enquire and actually verify the nature of these perspectives   
  . This is how I’ve interpreted what they told me… 


 
Collaborative Thinking: I engaged in enquiring communication, facilitation and/or mentoring to learn about these perspectives   and to bring them into the decision making process in the following ways… 

 
Perspective Coordination: I learned more about the con.icts and tensions between the people and groups involved in this decision and I sought to resolve these tensions by locating this/these principles that show their common ground... 

Systems Thinking: This/these Patterns help identify the overarching principles that help unite these perspectives… 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Source is a Pattern you can always start with. 

Rationale: I am using the information from this exercise to craft the presentation of the arguments supporting my decision in the following ways…

Decision Making: I moved from deliberating about this decision to taking action by using this/these creative insight(s)    based on this/these unifying principles  … 


Decision Guide 
“Decision implies the end of deliberation and the beginning of action.” 
William Starbuck, professor in residence at the University of Oregon’s Charles H. Lundquist College of Business. 
 
Methods: There is no magic formula for deciding on a course of action. All good decisions are made using a combination of these methods: 
• Analysis 

• Logical reasoning 

• Intuition 

• Emotion 


 
Elements: Good decisions also take into account these elements: 
 
• The causes of a challenge 

• The goals that need to be met 

• Different decision making options 

• The perceived outcomes of different options 


 
Often Practiced: Many currently taught decision making processes involve listing all the options recommended by different stakeholders and choosing the one with the most strengths and the least weaknesses for the widest range of stakeholders. This strategy involves deciding on compromises and trade offs. 
Better Practice: Better decision making, supported by the method being advocated here, relies on .nding the hidden commonalities between seemingly divergent perspectives and using these as leverage points to formulate creative solutions. These solutions are intended to meet more of all of the stakeholders’ needs. Note: the most important and reliable commonality for uniting perspectives is their relationship and importance to the purpose (Source) of the organization, unit, group, or team.

In plain language: The Rhythm Pattern represents everything in your organization that has to do with cycles in time. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Rhythm Pattern represents the repetitions, swings, pulses, synchronizations and other regularities of processes that characterize a system’s unfolding in time. The role of Rhythm is to coordinate elements and events in time. Rhythm demonstrates the effectiveness of regular patterns in time that assist elements of a system to engage in coordinated processes. Rhythms must be balanced so that, on the one hand, their regularity does not become .xed, which may cause problems if conditions require change; or, on the other hand, change too often or too quickly, which can pose unnecessary or costly adaptive challenges for the rest of the system. 
 
In plain language: The Polarity Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with things that seem like opposites, but are often just two different sides of the same coin. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Polarity Pattern represents opposing forces as two ends of a continuum in dynamic interplay.The role of Polarity is to build and liberate the potential within systems. The relationship between polarities stores potential and their integration liberates energies that drive the activity of systems. On the one hand, Polarities must be integrated to take advantage of both approaches, but, on the other hand, they must also be maintained to build potential. 
8 

 
In plain language: The Structure Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with its supporting frameworks. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Structure Pattern represents the solid, relatively unchanging, frameworks, scaffolding or ‘bones’ of a system. The role of Structure is to support the more active and changeable aspects of systems. Structure demonstrates the effectiveness of having enduring frameworks that support the more dynamic activity. Structural frameworks, on the one hand, must be the most solid, unchanging, and enduring aspects of a system, but, on the other hand, they must also have some capacity for ready, if limited, .exibility. 
 
In plain language: The Exchange Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with trades of energy and resources between its different people and groups. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Exchange Pattern represents the material, energetic and informational trades made between specialized elements of a system. The role of Exchange is to provide the production and ef.ciency gains of systems. Exchanges between elements with unique capabilities demonstrates the productivity and ef.ciency gains of systems that allows them to outcompete any group of non-specialized, non-trading elements. 
Exchanges must be balanced so that, one the one hand, elements within a system specialize enough that through trade the system gains a competitive advantage; but, on the other hand, elements retain the ability to cover off more than one function so as to ensure resilience. 
 
In plain language: The Creativity Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with emergent new opportunities. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Creativity Pattern represents the emergence of new forms and processes within systems. The role of Creativity is to help systems adapt to changes in the ever-changing environments around them. 
Creativity demonstrates the large gains that can be made through successful innovation. Creativity must be balanced so that, on the one hand, a system gains the bene.ts of successful innovation; but, on the other hand, it does not become exhausted through continually expending energy on uncertain experiments. 
 
In plain language: The Dynamics Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with systems level change. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework 

De.nition: The Dynamics Pattern represents integration, coordination, and control at the systems level itself. The role of Dynamics is to provide highly leveraged means for integrating, coordinating and controlling systems level operations that support the attainment of goals. Dynamics demonstrates the often very highly leveraged effects of integrations, coordination, and control at the systems level. Dynamics must be balanced so that, on the one hand, integration, coordination, and control processes are effectively leveraged for meeting goals; but, on the other hand, care must be taken not to apply too much leverage causing systems dynamics to be tHRown out of control. 
 
In plain language: The Source Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization that has to do with its ultimate purpose. Below is its more precise de.nition within the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

De.nition: The Source Pattern is most simply represented as a system’s purpose. It’s more complete de.nition is that it signi.es the quality of the collective awareness of the ongoing evolution of a system’s purpose, essential nature, or 'Source Code'. The role of Source is to serve as the core collective inquiry: “What is the origin and evolution our identity and purpose?” Source demonstrates the power of collective inquiry to generate awareness that strengthens the self-organizing drive all systems have to co-create the conditions that allow them to meet their aims and thrive. Source must be balanced so that, on the one hand, a strong connection is maintained to the origin of a system’s identity and purpose; but, on the other hand, a strong inquiry is maintained that allows that same identity and purpose to evolve in a way that helps 
it thrive under changing circumstances. 9

2 Introduction to PatternDynamics™: 
How the patterns of nature show us the principles of sustainability 
 
 
 
 

 
The Story: How I Created PatternDynamics and Why 
by Tim Winton 
 

 
After completing university studies in Canada in English Literature and Architecture, I moved to Australia. The next year, 1994, I attended a Permaculture Design course. At that point I committed to making ‘sustainability’ my life’s work. After an initial few years learning the fundamentals of ecological design and practical techniques in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land management, I founded a residential centre for sustainability education on a rural property in the hinterland of the north coast of New South Wales, Australia. 
 
This went on to become a ten year experiment in forming an ‘educational community for sustainability’. During this period, as well as becoming a sustainability educator, I developed careers in reforestation contracting, organic agriculture, ecological design and sustainability consulting. 
 
The centre was called Permaforest Trust, and it was here, along with experiences from my work in various aspects of the sustainability industry, that I developed the foundation insight that was to form PatternDynamics™ as a sustainability pattern language. The insight was that: the patterns of 
nature hold the key to the principles of sustainability of any system, of any type, at any scale. 
 
At the Permaforest Trust we had access to all the technologies and strategies we needed to live sustainably. We had the capacity to generate our own energy using solar panels, grow our own food in restorative agricultural systems, integrate our wastes back into the environment, share resources as a community to lower our environmental footprint, and to restore soils and ecosystems. But, ironically, the centre itself – as a ‘system’– struggled to be sustainable. This is true of any intentionally sustainable community I know of. The stresses became so great that there were times when the project almost failed completely. My work outside the centre, in the world at large, demonstrated the same dynamic: the sustainable systems I participated in establishing there also struggled to be sustained. Globally, too, sustainability was struggling. Why was sustainability proving to be so unsustainable? This became an overriding question for me. I think the answer holds a key for the possibility of human thriving on this planet that has 
not been properly recognised or addressed to date. 
How I Created PatternDynamics and Why (continued) 3 

 
 
 
 
 
Our problem at the centre was not that we needed more sustainability technologies or strategies – we had more than enough of these. Our challenges had to do with how the people in the project interacted to form a ‘system’ that could support these technologies and strategies. We tended to have different ideas about how the centre should be organised: some people wanted it to be more structured than others, some more creative, some more feminine or more masculine, some more focused on trade and financial sustainability, some on vision and purpose, 
some on management 
structures, some on 
 
 
 
 
 
systems. I call the ability to recognise and understand multiple patterns of organisation ‘systems thinking’. Intuitively at first, I began experimenting with using natural systems to introduce people to balancing and integrating many patterns, not just the limited amount they identified with based on their cultural conditioning. As I developed and formalised this approach into PatternDynamics™, 
it proved to be a powerful method for making this kind of systems thinking meaningful and therefore useful in organisational settings. In the end it allowed 
us to overcome many of our challenges at 
Permaforest Trust and 
 
programs and schedules and so on. These different views caused real problems and conflict in the social system of our small community. Often these different perspectives would literally go to war with each other: for example people who advocated creativity and freedom would think of people who believed in structure as wrong or even ethically 
Systems Thinking 
that facilitates 
Organisational Sustainability 
for creating a 
Thriving Planetary Civilisation 
 
to create a unique and quite special sustainability community. 
 
What became clear to me in this long experiment was that Permaforest Trust was a microcosm of the global sustainability macrocosm. On a planetary scale, we have enough technologies and strategies to create a 
unsound, and visa versa. 
Or, folks who believed in developing strong trade 
systems would be either glorified or reviled. What became clear after a time was that people’s cultural values dictated, to a significant extent, the patterns of organisation they aligned with: that is, people tended to identify with patterns that they found culturally meaningful. 
 
Gradually I came to realise that the natural systems around us, which had sustained themselves for many millions of years, exhibited patterns of organisation that resembled all of our various views – never just one or even just a few, but many, many different patterns were always present all the time. 
Nature demonstrates that integrating multiple patterns of organisation is the key to sustaining its 
sustainable world. What 
is critical for taking sustainability to the 
next level are tools that make integrating multiple patterns and perspectives meaningful. This is the key to enabling human organisations to participate in and facilitate the spread of the sustainability technologies and strategies we already have. 
Just as all ecological systems at all levels play their unique roles in the overall sustainability of nature, so each human organisation must play its unique role in global sustainability. 
 
PatternDynamics™ is a tool I developed so you can learn systems thinking and bring it to your organisation as a way of creating the meaning that will allow it to play its role in facilitating the development of a truly thriving planetary civilization.

  Theory 
PatternDynamics™ resolves complexity 
The challenge of our age is to facilitate global sustainability through the crea- tion of a truly thriving planetary civilization. 
The key to this challenge is our capacity to deal with complexity. We have created an increasingly large, fast paced and complex world, but our ability to coordinate ourselves has not kept pace. 
PatternDynamics™ is a simple tool that can be learned by anyone to overcome the challenges posed by complex systems – at any scale. Here’s how it works: 
s 4HE KEY TO COMPLEXITY IS systems thinking 
s 4HE KEY TO SYSTEMS THINKING IS Patterns; and 
s 4HE KEY TO USING 0ATTERNS IS TO FORM THEM INTO A language. 
PatternDynamics™ is a language of visual Patterns – a ‘Sustainability Pattern Language’– that will help you understand, communicate and design solutions at the systems level. By learning PatternDynamics™ you will gain 
a powerful new capacity as a ‘systems thinker’– a skill that is often thought to be unteachable. 
With this skill you will learn to create Cultures of Sustainability and to facilitate Deep Sustainability Design: sustainability strategies that help resolve complex challenges at any level of organisation, from the community to the planetary, and in any domain, from business to governance to institutional. 
 
 
PatternDynamics™ is based on 3 simple ideas 
1. Sustainable Natural Patterns: 


Complex natural systems exhibit consistent general patterns of organisation that have allowed them to persist and thrive for many hundreds of millions of years. These ‘patterns of organisation’ provide us with design templates that illustrate how complex dynamics systems work. Natural patterns are like 
‘keys’ that help us unlock the mysteries of working with whole systems. As such, they provide us with principles we can rely on to guide us in the creation and design of sustainable futures. 
2. The Power of Language: 


Language – the system of symbols we use to communicate – has a powerful role in shaping what we actually see. In each historical age people have developed symbols that help them to see, communicate about, and act on the things that are important for their collective survival and prosperity. What has become clear with regard to complex sustainability challenges is that we do not have effective languages for seeing the ‘whole system’. 
3. A Sustainability Pattern Language: 


Our current spoken, written and mathematical languages are excellent for analyzing the nature of ‘parts’, but they are not optimized for helping us see how these parts are connected and organized as ‘wholes’. By combining the patterns of nature with the power of language, PatternDynamics™ creates a Sustainability Pattern Language – a language of wholistic symbols designed to help us develop the systems thinking capacity needed to meet the complex challenges of creating a sustainable planetary civilization.

  About 
Local structures create planetary culture 5 
Our basic philosophy is that the biggest lever in human affairs is 
culture – the understandings, beliefs, values and their expression that provide the shared meaning that glues us together in social systems. 
Culture is an invisible field of shared consciousness that shapes our behaviours and dictates the acceptance or rejection of social changes. This is what organisational change expert Peter Drucker means when he states: “culture eats strategy for breakfast.” 
PatternDynamics™ creates ‘Cultures of Sustainability‘, cultures that value systems thinking and build the capacity to resolve complex organisational challenges. 
Our approach to creating cultures of sustainability is to focus on the organisational level – what we call ‘local structures’. Local structures provide human scale environments to develop complex problem solving skills. 
We believe that learning to thrive by resolving complex challenges inside local structures requires the same culture, competencies and capacities needed 
to create sustainability outside the organisation, where it must play a role in global sustainability – what we refer to as creating ‘planetary culture’. 
 
PatternDynamics™: a planetary social enterprise 
Our vision is to provide a real and practical tool for creating the consciousness required to form a planetary civilization and a truly sustainable, thriving global society. 
As an enterprise, our defining identity and purpose is to do this by providing a social benefit through the dissemination of PatternDynamics™ (PD), an Integral Sustainability Pattern Language. PD is a way of learning the principles of sustainability through the patterns of nature in order to communicate about ‘whole systems’ and to facilitate the sustainability of complex organisations at all scales. 
We think of PD as a language of human evolution. 
As a Pattern Language, PatternDynamics™ is a technology in the form of Intellectual Property. The Intellectual Property consists of a set of visual Patterns, their Charts, descriptions and usage instructions. 
As a social enterprise PatternDynamics™ is foremost a Community of Practice – a community of PD practitioners derived from a wide range of people, invited from all domains and levels of society, who are committed to facilitating the transition to a sustainable world. 
PatternDynamics Pty Ltd is a for-profit company charged with supporting the development of the PD community of practice such that:

Rhythm 
Repetitions in Time 
 
 

 
‘Rhythm’ represents the waves and cycles of a system. 
 
All natural systems have regular repetitions and cycles that order events over time. The most important ecological cycle is the annual changing of the seasons caused by the tilt in the earth’s axis relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. The moon causes ocean tides to ebb and flow with a complex monthly rhythm which is in turn overlaid with the pulse of waves caused by the wind. Both the seasons and the tides then coordinate biological activities, fertility cycles, resource pulses and a host of other natural rhythms. What role do 
rhythms play within a system? Think about how having holidays at irregular and random times from year to year would affect the organisation of your workplace. What would happen if there was never any variation to the routine? Does your household function better when your family’s weekly routine is regular and uninterrupted? How could you balance an existing Rhythm or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How do rhythms serve to coordinate systems?

The temporal aspects of systems. 
 
The Rhythm Pattern represents the repetitions, swings, pulses and synchronizations that align the elements and activities of a system through time. Rhythms provide a regularity that allows elements of a system to coordinate with each other. Rhythms must possess a reliable regularity, but they must also change and adapt to evolving circumstances. The role of Rhythm is to coordinate events in time. 
 
The principle of good timing: the enduring health of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the temporal capacity for both regularity and variation, for a given context. 
 
The Rhythm Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
 
Organism: All life forms have rhythms of activity that vary in order to support the health of that organism. Respiration in animals is a good example of a rhythmic activity that serves to coordinate the activity of the entire organism in order to keep it healthy. If the rhythm of respiration is too slow the animal will not have enough oxygen to drive metabolic processes, but if it is too fast it may cause hyperventilation – the loss of too much carbon dioxide from the blood and resultant loss of blood pressure. 
 
Ecosystem: Humans have intervened in natural forest fire cycles by introducing smaller, but more frequent fires. This keeps the fuel load from building up to the point where there are large, hot fires that may destroy property. Changing the Rhythm of fire frequency has other wider effects on the ecosystem, including changing species composition of both plants and animals, altering soil conditions and changing predator/prey relationships. 
 
Organisation: Businesses have financial reporting cycles that influence rhythms within the business like capital expenditures, investment strategies and wage level adjustments. In most cases annual reporting is sufficient, but if a business is undergoing a period of rapid growth or change it may be necessary to do more frequent financial analysis in order to keep the business healthy. 
 
Economy: All scales of economies throughout history have displayed extremities and irregularities in their levels of activity which has posed challenges for the sustainability of those economies. This is referred to as a ‘boom and bust’ dynamic. Governments and financial institutions regularly intervene to try to moderate extreme swings in financial activities and to introduce more reliability into the rhythms of financial markets.

Polarity 
Integration of Opposites 
 
 

 
‘Polarity’ represents the relationship between opposites. 
 
All natural systems have opposing elements and dynamics that are really just two sides of one thing. Growth and decay in biological systems are two aspects of the cycle of life – although they seem like opposing processes, one cannot exist without the other. They are necessary compliments. What role do polarities play within systems? Think about what your workplace would be like if everyone spent all their time communicating and no time actually acting to get things done. Think also about the opposite scenario where only action 
was prioritized and no one communicated to anyone else. How does the more masculine drive to get things done interact with the more feminine tendency to discuss how that should happen? 
Does an organisation that needs to make a big decision about its future direction need to prioritize a more masculine or a more feminine approach? How could you balance an existing Polarity or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How do polarities serve to coordinate systems?

The Polarity Pattern is closely related to and serves as an aspect of the Source Pattern, the most foundational organising principle within PatternDynamics™. 
 
The interplay of opposites within a system. 
 
The Polarity Pattern represents opposing forces as two ends of a continuum in dynamic interplay. The relationship between polarities stores potential and their integration liberates energies that drive the activity of systems. 
Polarities must be integrated to take advantage of both approaches, but they must also be maintained to build potential. The role of Polarity is to maintain the potential within systems. 
 
The principle of paradox: the enduring health of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the interplay of opposing dynamics, for a given context. 
 
The Polarity Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
 
Organism: All organisms must balance the relationship between inputs to their system and the outputs from their system. If an organism is growing then its inputs of nutrients need to exceed its output of wastes. If conditions change in the environment and nutrients for that organism become scarce it must then adjust so that outputs exceed inputs, allowing it to sHRink and survive. 
 
Ecosystem: The interplay between periods of orderly growth and the chaotic bush fires in northern boreal forests is a major planetary regulator of oxygen levels, and by extension the maintenance of atmospheric conditions favorable to life. If the forests do not burn when oxygen levels become high then less fire adapted ecosystems will ignite. If boreal forests were to continue to burn when oxygen levels are low some organisms would struggle to respire. 
 
Organisation: The interplay between the more feminine capacity for connection and relationship and the more masculine capacity for individual achievement provides a potential within an organisation for outcomes 
not able to be attained by either polarity alone. A relational approach is necessary for good communications and good decision making, but a capacity for achievement is necessary to enact the decisions made through those good communications. 
 
Economy: The economy is potentized by the dynamic relationship between cooperation within enterprises and competition with outside rivals. Competition leads to productivity and efficiency gains, but unless it is integrated with cooperation it becomes a negative force creating hyper- individualism which causes social disintegration. Cooperation creates 
synergies, but unless it is integrated with competition it leads to a loss of drive by high performing individuals necessary for a strong economy.

Structure 
Enduring Frameworks 
 
 

 
‘Structure’ represents the bones of a system. 
 
All natural systems have frameworks that provide relatively fixed and unchanging support structures for more dynamic aspects of the system. Forests are based on the tall, enduring biological structure of trees. Higher animals have strong bone skeletons and lower animals like insects have rigid exoskeletons. Even relatively soft biological cells have cytoskeletons that maintain their structural integrity. What role do structures play within a system? Think about what an organisation would be like if its legal frameworks changed frequently 
or were removed altogether. Think also about what it would be like if these legal frameworks never changed and remained the same now as they were hundreds of years ago. How do unwritten, but well understood, codes of behaviour provide stability within families? When do these sorts of structures start to cause problems? How could you balance an existing Structure or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How do structures serve to coordinate systems?

The enduring frameworks of systems. 
 
The Structure Pattern represents the solid, relatively unchanging, frameworks, scaffolding or ‘bones’ of a system. Structural frameworks must be the most solid and enduring aspects of a system, but they must also have some capacity for flexibility. The role of Structure is to support the more active and changeable aspects of systems. 
 
The principle of effective frameworks: the enduring health of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the structural capacities for both rigidity and flexibility, for a given context. 
 
The Structure Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
 
Organism: All higher animals have interior structural frameworks called a skeleton who’s job is to provide support for the rest of the body. If the 
bones of a creature’s skeleton become too brittle and lose their flexibility, they may break. If bones are too flexible and soft they cannot support the weight of the other elements of the body. 
 
Ecosystem: Mangrove trees are the central living structural element in tidal wetlands. They hold the shifting sands in place with their multi-stalked aerial root systems. Mangrove trees have evolved to provide enough structure to hold the shifting sands in place, but they are not so rigid that they cannot flex in high winds or tidal currents. 
 
Organisation: Companies are governed by legal structures called constitutions. These documents provide the enduring framework of rules and regulations that shareholders, directors and executives must follow in participating in the dynamic operation of the business. If the corporate constitution changes too frequently it undermines the integrity of the agreements that allow people to work together effectively. If it is too rigid and does not change at all over time, the business will not be able to adapt to changing circumstances. 
 
Economy: All modern economies measure the level and success of their activities through financial frameworks called accounting systems. If accounting structures are changed without good reason, it can lead to inaccurate financial reporting, misallocation of resources and fraud. If accounting frameworks are too static and they are not changed at all over time, they may become irrelevant in an evolving economy.

Exchange 
Specialization and Trade 
 
 

 
‘Exchange’ signifies the productive capacity of systems. 
 
All natural systems have productive processes driven by specialized elements exchanging energy and materials with each other. Flowers distribute nectar as a natural energy product in an exchange with insects and animals that do the work of distributing the plant’s pollen. This is a more efficient and therefore more productive outcome than if the flower had to organize its own pollination and the insects and animals had to photosynthesize their own sugars from sunlight energy. What role do exchanges play within a system? Think about what an organisation would be like if it did not have a unique role within the 
economy that allowed it to trade its goods or services with other organisations and individuals. What would a business be like that tried to be an extreme generalist and work in a multitude of unrelated industries? Alternatively, what would it be like to be so highly specialized that your role was not often required within an organisation? How do you choose the appropriate level of specialization? How does trade amongst specialists make everybody better off? How could you balance an existing Exchange or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? 
How do exchanges serve to coordinate systems?

The productive capacity of systems. 
 
The Exchange Pattern represents the material, energetic and informational trades made between elements with unique capacities that enable the productivity of systems to be greater than any group of non specialized, non trading elements. The role of Exchange is to provide the production and efficiency gains of systems. 
 
The principle of productivity: the enduring health of a system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the degree of specialization and the scale of trade, for a given context. 
 
The Exchange Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
 
Organism: The major organs, which act as sub systems within animals, specialize in unique capacities: hormone regulation by the endocrine system, filtration by the kidneys, pumping blood by the heart, and gaseous interchange by the lungs, to name but a few. The organs have evolved specializations which allow them to enter into relational exchange as part of a greater system, but many are not so highly specialized that some of their functions are not replicated by other organs. For instance the kidneys and heart have secondary endocrine functions supporting hormone regulation in the body. 
Ecosystem: Specialized fungi translocate mineral elements through the soil and deliver them to the roots of plants where they are exchanged for 
sugars produced in the plant’s leaves. If a fungus specializes to the degree where it can exchange with only one species of plant it may become very efficient, but if its plant partner disappears so will the fungus. If the fungus is less specialized and has a generalized capacity to trade with many species it may not be maximally efficient, but it will be more resilient to changes in plant distributions. 
Organisation: Specialist employees exchange skills like accounting, management, trade skills, and IT expertise in order to create productive business systems. If the employees are so highly specialized that they do not understand enough about other roles within the business to relate to them, then specialization has gone too far. If employees and managers are too generalist in their approach tasks may be covered off by a number of 
people, but they will not be done with same level of expertise or productivity. 
Economy: Economies are composed of individuals, businesses and whole industries that develop unique capacities and then trade to form a multi- scaled system of exchange. Highly specialized businesses and institutions are needed as economies grow more complex, but high specialization makes business vulnerable to market changes that marginalize the demand for their unique goods or services. All businesses in an economic system must find the balance between high specialization that brings productivity gains and more general capacities that allow them to adapt to changing circumstances.

Creativity 
Innovative Adaptations 
 
 

 
‘Creativity’ represents the emergence of new forms within a system. 
 
All natural systems display the capacity for creative evolution in response to changes in the conditions around them. Animals that camouflage themselves to mimic their environment must evolve their strategies as the landscape around them changes. Plant species will continually evolve new forms of protection as their predators evolve to overcome previous protective strategies. What role does creativity play within a system? Think about what it would be like if an organisation was constantly 
reinventing itself. Would it have enough periods of stable activity to be productive? Alternatively, what if an organisation never changed any aspect of how it was organised? How much energy does it take to create a new recipe versus using one you already know well? How could you balance an existing Creativity dynamic or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How does Creativity serve to coordinate systems?

The emergence of novel adaptations within systems. 
The Creativity Pattern represents the emergence of new forms and processes that help systems adapt to changes in the ever changing environments around them. The generation of new forms and processes is a risky, energy and resource intensive act that must be balanced by the successful operation of the system to support its ongoing function. 
The principle of adaptive emergence: the enduring health of a system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of creative experimentation on the one hand and the ongoing successful operation of the system on the other, for a given context. 
The Creativity Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
Organism: Organisms as diverse as viruses and mammals show both minor adaptations to temporary changes in things like moisture availability 
and major evolutionary leaps to accommodate permanently changed circumstances, such as climate change. Any organism that places too much emphasis on experimental adaptations risks using too much energy innovating, thereby compromising existing productivity. On the other hand, organisms that do not adapt at all or too slowly will be out-competed by organisms that adapt to fit the changing circumstances better. 
Ecosystem: Forest ecosystems display adaptive responses that allow them to recover from disturbances as diverse as wind tHRow, land slip, human 
harvesting, pest infestation and fire. If conditions like human harvesting place a greater imperative to adapt to disturbance than the forest can manage, it may be replaced by another vegetation type more suited to that type 
of disturbance. Alternatively, if forest ecosystems are protected by humans from the cycles of disturbance to which they have adapted, like fire, they may lose their natural vigour and become prone to attack by things they are not adapted to, like pests and disease held in check by normal disturbance events. 
Organisation: All organisations must balance the rate of creative change to their systems of operation. If changes are made too frequently and speculatively the energy spent by members adapting to the new changes 
and the energy required to repair failures may compromise the health of the organisation. If changes are not made frequently enough the organisation may become dysfunctional by virtue of being out of step with the world around it. 
Economy: If governments make large or frequent changes to tax law without consulting industry and without giving enough notice of changes, business may find it difficult and resource intensive to adapt to the new fiscal conditions. If government regulators are slow to change tax law to fit with changed economic conditions then it may have an equally disruptive effect because tax revenue may not be being collected effectively enough to support the institutions required for a robust economy.

Dynamics 
Integrated Systems 
 
 

 
‘Dynamics’ signifies the coordination of processes at the systems level. 
 
All natural systems have processes that integrate dynamics at the systems level. In terrestrial ecosystems fire events can cause changes in species composition that favour more future fire events, starting a positive feedback loop that amplifies fire frequency. Small adjustments over many iterative cycles can lead systems to adapt considerably over time to events like climate change or soil fertility decreases. What role do systems dynamics play within systems? Think about what it would be like within an organisation if there 
was no way for feedback to be given or received by anyone. How would this affect the ability to adjust operations to suit new conditions? How does feedback operate to either enhance or diminish a process within a system? What effect does making small changes over many cycles have versus making a dramatic change over a relatively short period of time? How could you balance existing Dynamics or integrate new ones into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How do Dynamics serve to coordinate systems?

Any process that coordinates dynamics at the systems level. 
 
The Dynamics Pattern represents integrated and coordinated systemic functioning. Systemic dynamics work to refine and adjust the 
coordination of elements and processes and their relationships through feedback mechanisms, iterative refinements, synergies and spontaneous adaptations. Small changes to systemic dynamics can have great effect and overuse may tHRow systems out of balance. 
 
The principle of systemic refinement: the enduring health of a system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the use 
of refinements to adjust the coordination and integration of system processes, for a given context. 
 
The Dynamics Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational organising pattern of all systems. 
 
Organism: The human nervous system is constantly taking measurements of ambient temperature which then feeds back to adjust activity levels and the body’s metabolic rate. If the iteration period of cycles of adjustment 
is left too long the system will swing wildly from extreme to extreme. If the cycles are too frequent the system will become stressed from the constant activity of adjustment. 
 
Ecosystem: Coral Reefs are formed by a symbiotic relationship between a calcium carbonate secreting polyp and a photosynthetic algae which lives within its tissues. This dynamic synergy allows these tiny creatures 
to build vast reef systems. If the individual organisms give up too much autonomy the reef system will lose adaptability. If the different organisms do not cooperate fully enough a reef system will not be possible. 
 
Organisation: Adjustments to business systems over many cycles helps improve organisational performance. If the cycles of adjustment are too frequent, too much energy is used up in making adjustments and not enough is available for productive activity. If the cycles are too infrequent, the organisation may drift off course and lose market share. 
 
Economy: Central banking institutions provide feedback that adjusts the rate of growth in the economy through the manipulation of interest rates. If the central bank cuts prime lending rates too much the economy will overheat as businesses borrow money and expand their operations. 
If the bank is too slow to cut rates during a slowdown the economy may go into recession.

Source signifies the collective consciousness of a system’s essential nature – the awareness of its fundamental ‘pattern of organisation’. 
More specifically it relates to the origin of identity and purpose, how this evolves over time, and how it affects a system’s self-organising capacity. All systems in nature have clear patterns that form the same atoms, molecules and cells into different self-organising entities. For instance, different trees, animals, and ecosystems all have distinct identities and roles that evolve over time 
to adapt to changing circumstances. How does a system’s evolution affect the parts of that system? Think about what it means when an organisation changes its core identity and purpose. How does 
this affect the awareness of what the organisation is, who it attracts, and their level of commitment? If it is a radical change, will members still identify strongly enough with the organisation to participate fully and effectively? If an organisation does not change at all, will it remain relevant as things change around it? Have you been part of a group response to an emergency? How strong was the collective consciousness of the identity and purpose of that group? How did it affect 
self-organising capacity? How could you balance Source or integrate it more fully into a system in your life to improve how it is organised? How does Source serve to coordinate systems?

The two enclosed shapes inside the larger oval represent systems that are part of a larger scale system enveloping them, illustrating the fundamental part/whole nature of reality which is composed of systems within systems within systems, ad infinitum. The enveloping oval also signifies that systems have inner, subjective consciousness and outer, objective form. Where the two inner shapes meet in the center symbolizes the origin of the form of that type of system. 
 
The most foundational pattern of organisation: the consciousness of the origin and evolution of identity and purpose. 
 
The Source Pattern signifies the origin of order – a system’s conscious identity and purpose. When awareness of the primary pattern of any system is clear and its purpose or function is clear, the parts have clear roles within the larger pattern of that system. It is the conscious field of identity and purpose that defines a system’s type, or pattern, that in turn enacts the foundational self-organising capacity of its parts. 
 
The principle of Unity: the enduring health of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of changes to a system’s unifying consciousness of identity and purpose, for a given context. 
 
The Source Pattern signifies the primordial foundation and origin of order. All other Patterns represent different aspects of Source. 
 
Organism: The first complex (eukaryotic) cells evolved as a new pattern of organisation of already existing simpler (prokaryotic) cells and bacteria. The purpose of this new symbiosis was to create a system in which each of the elements does better as part of the system than as a lone individual. Within the identity of the eukaryotic cell some of the bacteria adapted to become the power plants (mitochondria) and some adapted to become organelles that capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy (chloroplasts). 
 
Ecosystem: Lichen colonies are formed through a symbiotic relationship between fungi and green algae. Both a fungus and an alga have different patterns of organisation as independent organisms. When in relationship their joint form is distinct and identifiable as a lichen. Through the 
symbiotic organisation of the lichen form they are able to colonize harsh environments like desert where they exude compounds that stabilize the shifting sands so seeds of higher plants can germinate. If conditions are suitable the’ parts’ of the lichen system my revert to their original identities as fungi and algae respectively. 
 
Organisation: The clear identity and purpose of an organic farming operation is to farm without harmful chemicals so that it may provide healthy food, nurture healthy soils and sustain ecosystems. Its clear identity and purpose and its suitability for repairing degraded environmental conditions has assisted organics to become one of the fastest growing industries on the planet. 
 
Economy: A community credit union lends money to and takes deposits from local people and businesses only, clearly contrasting it with the identity and purpose of commercial banks which operate a much wider range of financial services over much larger geographical areas. The dilution of larger banking institutions’ identities and purposes as they diversified into insurance and the brokering of financial derivatives has undermined their ongoing viability.

PatternDynamics Glossary 
An Integral Sustainability Pattern Language for understanding, communicating and designing solutions for the sustainability of any system at any scale. 
 
A simple diagram created in PatternDynamics™ that signifies a natural pattern of organisation. 
 
Systems thinking can best be explained as a capacity for understanding both the characteristics and behaviour of ‘parts’ and the patterns of organisation that form those parts into ‘wholes’– complex dynamic self- organising systems. 
 
A culture of sustainability is a set of understandings that gives shared meaning to what a group thinks will makes a particular system healthier and more enduring. In PatternDynamics™ we create that meaning by using Patterns. The Pattern diagrams are a tool for learning to understand the principles of how whole systems work and for having discussions about how to improve them using systems thinking. 
 
Deep Sustainability Design is a design process that is supported by a Culture of Sustainability. Any sustainability design strategy that is not supported by the culture that has to live with it will not be supported, and it will stand a high risk of failure. By building a Culture of Sustainability with the people who must use or implement the design solution, it will be meaningful to them and therefore get their support, giving it a much higher chance of success. 
 
Natural systems are organised in a way that has allowed them to persist for hundreds of millions of years. By looking for the patterns that are followed in organising individual elements into those whole systems, we can deduce 
principles that help us understand the basis of sustainable design. This is one approach to learning systems thinking. 
 
A Pattern Language is a set of symbols that represent principles of good design. This concept was first developed by architect CHRistopher Alexander. In the case of PatternDynamics™ the symbols relate to the principles informing the design of sustainable natural systems. The word ‘Integral’ signifies that PatternDynamics™ is related to ‘comprehensiveness’,‘wholistic’ approaches and the synthesizing activity of thinking about how things are put together rather than relying exclusively on the activity of analysis, which is used to pull things apart. PatternDynamics™ is based in, but not limited to, Integral Theory developed by Ken Wilber. The use of the word Sustainability indicates a relationship to configuring the human world so that it may support the natural world on which it is dependent on an ongoing basis. 
 
Understandings, ideas, concepts, meaning and values, relating to the enduring health of a system.

PatternDynamics Glossary continued 29 
The First Order Patterns are shown across the top and along the left hand side. The Second Order Patterns are color coded and arranged in columns of 7 under their respective First Order Pattern as Aspects of those First Order Patterns. Each Second Order Patterns is a composite of a major of component of the First Order Pattern above it and a minor component of the First Order Pattern to the left of it. 
 
Source represents the most primordial and foundational Pattern at work in the Universe. The Source Pattern signifies the origin of order – a system’s conscious identity and purpose. When awareness of the primary pattern of any system is clear and its purpose or function is clear, the parts have clear roles within the larger pattern of that system. 
 
Aspects are different facets of a Pattern; they could also be seen as different properties of a Pattern enacted by taking different perspectives on the features of that Pattern. For example, Source has multiple Aspects represented by the 6 First Order Patterns. In turn, the 6 First Order Patterns each have multiple Aspects represented by their seven Second Order Aspects. (See the First Order Chart and the PatternDynamics™ Holarchy Chart.) 
 
The 6 First Order Aspects of Source. 
 
The 49 Second Order Aspects of Source, groups of seven which are also Aspects of each First Order Pattern. (See the PatternDynamics™ Holarchy Chart.) 
 
In PatternDynamics the term Holon signifies a perspective on the nature of systems, where systems have the property of parts organized into wholes, but also the property of having both interior, subjective dimensions and exterior, material dimensions. A Holon refers to a system seen as fundamentally composed of four perspectives: parts, wholes, interiors and exteriors.

Intellectual Property (IP) and Use 33 
We would like to make the terms of use of PatternDynamics™ as clear and as free of difficult to comprehend legal jargon as possible. 
At the same time, it is our intention to communicate those terms in a way that is effective and legally sound. 
Here goes: 
PatternDynamics™ is intellectual property (IP) comprised of (but not limited to) its Pattern diagrams and Charts, which are the trademarks of their creator James Timothy Winton, and its definitions, descriptions, examples and principles, which are copyright also of James Timothy Winton, their author. 
You are authorized to use free download resources and materials posted on the official PatternDynamics web site (located at www. patterndynamics.com.au) in the spirit in which they are intended – as 
an Integral Sustainability Pattern Language for increasing understanding, communication and design in systems understandings of human sustainability and thriving – for personal not-for-profit purposes. For all other uses a license must be sought and secured. 
Personal not-for-profit use means that you must be using it for both personal and not-for-profit uses at the same time. For instance, in your own personal blog you might want to post Pattern images and link back to Pattern descriptions on the PatternDynamics™ web site in order to explore some of the systems dynamics of a news or current affairs issue. That would be fine as long as your blog is not a profit making enterprise and you are using it as an individual and not as part of an organisation or its activities. Remember this authorization only applies to material posted to and free downloads from the official PatternDynamics™ website. If you are using PatternDynamics™ either in a for-profit situation, or as part of an initiative within an organisation, or you are using PatternDynamics™ IP from another source, then you need to secure a license via this website. This can be done in a number of ways and it’s probably much easier than you think. 
When PatternDynamics™ is being used for personal and not-for-profit purposes, we refer to this as ‘informal use’. This allows PatternDynamics™ to be used as a publicly available language for communicating about systems and it allows for PatternDynamics™ to be shared by individuals or informal groups of individuals. No license is required in this case. 
In any situation where PD or any of its resources are being used as part of the official activities of a named or incorporated organisation – for instance in organisational communications, strategic planning, as an organisational resource, or for any other purpose – then we deem this to be ‘formal use’ by an organisation and therefore no longer ‘personal’ use. Any use of PatternDynamics™ where anyone or any organisation is charging money 
in relation to the use of PD is deemed to be for-profit use and therefore ‘formal use’. Any formal use of PatternDynamics™ requires a license. 
We have made PatternDynamics™ free to use at the personal not-for-profit level of ‘informal use’ to create a global community resource. Having done that, we ask that you respect our claim to sole stewardship and ownership of PatternDynamics™ and its IP. This is so that we may exchange PatternDynamics™ IP outside the personal not-for-profit domain in order to secure the resources to enable its integrity and ongoing development in service of that global community resource.

Learning Pathways Guide 
 
 
Context and Purpose 
The purpose of this Forum Training Community is to help you learn a practice of living systems organisation, which is a form of self-organisation, based on purpose-driven, collaborative systems thinking. It is designed to support your skill development as a change agent, facilitator, coach, leader, or simply concerned human, in creating the more positive, open, participatory communities required to manage the complexity of the shift to a thriving planetary scale civilisation. 

Learning Pathways Guide (cont.) 
 
Our Theory of Change 
At PatternDynamics, our theory of change is that we start with ourselves. In that regard, it starts as a personal practice, that can equip you with skills to enable wiser decision making and more complex problem solving when you work in groups. It may be used as an organisational practice, but in our view, this should arise organically as the results of your practice become influential. 
Pedagogy 
Post-formal and planetary: Our approach to learning is collaborative and based on research from the learning sciences. Our aim is to provide community-supported learning pathways for the development of post-formal skills in purpose-driven, collaborative systems thinking, decision-making, and complex problem solving as they apply to facilitating more effective group self-organisation. It is our belief that this is a requirement for better managing the levels of complexity inherent in the shift to a planetary scale civilisation.

PatternDynamics Level 1 Training 
The recommended approach is to view one set of First Order Pattern videos per week, review it in the Training Guide, identify and reflect on this pattern in your own context, and comment in the Forum about your experiences/learnings. 
 
 
1. Watch the Source Course video and download the Source Course Worksheet 

2. Identify an opportunity to apply the Source Course principles in a personal or group context, and write about your reflections in the Forum.Your reflections should focus on how adjusting the balance associated with each principle could have made a difference in this context. 

3. Reply to at least two other community members comments as well. Ongoing discussions about these principles with others will deepen your learning. Post any questions that are not answered by community members to Tim or other Forum Moderators 

4. Download the PD Level I Training Guide and Level I Workshop Workbook 

5. Watch the Introduction video, referencing the PD Level I Training Guide and Workshop Workbook resources as required 

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each of the First Order patterns: Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity, Dynamics and Source over the following weeks 

7. For the Accreditation Pathway, when you have completed the Level I training videos and exercises, send a copy of your comments and replies for the Introduction (Source Course), and each of the First Order Patterns to info@patterndynamics.net with ‘PD Level I Accreditation Application’ in the subject line. There is no additional fee for this. When your submission is successful, we will email you the Level I PD Accredited Personal Practitioner logo 

8. Your accreditation is current while you remain a member of the FTC. Re-accreditation after a hiatus is assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the state of your practice 



 
Stay tuned for periodic live calls and webinars with Tim or other Accredited PD Practitioners to support your learning 

PatternDynamics Level II Training 
A deep dive into the 49 Second Order Patterns and the application of collaborative systems thinking to building decision-making skills. In this training, you will be introduced to Lectical learning tools through completing their Leadership Decision Making Assessment (LDMA). Accredited PD Level II training operates on the self-organising principles inherent in PD. 
 
 
 
 
1. Form a ‘cluster’ of 8 or 9 people with a desire for Level II Accreditation (to develop or find a cluster, go to Find My Cluster in the PD Level II training forum) 

2. When you have your cluster, contact info@patterndynamics.net and advise of your intention. We will respond with the next available schedule for your training 

3. Each PD Level II Training Cluster will engage in 10 weeks of online training 

4. The small group training consists of • approximately two hours per week of live online ‘class’ time with Tim Winton (recorded if you are not able to make a session) 

• reviewing the Level II videos 

• reviewing the Level II Training Guide and each of the 49 Second Order Patterns 

• reflection and application questions, comments and replies in your private cluster forum 

• The Lectica Decision Making Assessment (LDMA) and group debrief 

• An additional fee per cluster member (approximately $1500 USD) 




5. There is a maximum of four clusters per year 

6. Your accreditation is current while you remain a member of the FTC. Re-accreditation after a hiatus is assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the state of your practice 



PatternDynamics Level III Training 
 
 
 
 
 
Level III training is limited to Accredited Level II Practitioners and based on an application process. Please email info@patterndynamics.net for further information. 
 
 
 
PatternDynamics Workshop FacilitationTraining 
 
 
 
After completion of a live PatternDynamics Workshop and PD Level II Accredited Training, members may apply for Workshop Facilitation Accreditation Training. This consists of mentoring with an Accredited PD Workshop Facilitator in a live workshop context. Please email info@patterndynamics.net for more information.

The Challenge: Complexity 
 
 
 
• Over 20 years working as a leader in sustainability initiatives. 

• I struggled for years because I didn’t have tools for making e.ective changes to complex systems. 

• Then I discovered the power of collaborative systems thinking and developed the PatternDynamics™ framework. 

• Now I have reliable method for working more e.ectively with complex challenges. • It is substantiated by high quality research. 

• It is very practical and I can introduce it to others. 

• I no longer feel isolated because now I have a way of communicating my systems perspective.

Learning Outcomes 
 
There are three levels of skill attainment at each level of PatternDynamics™ Training 
• Familiarity: Where you can identify the relevant Patterns in your life, work, and world with reference to learning materials or support from more advanced practitioners. 

• Competency: Where you can identify the relevant Patterns consistently in most situations without reference to learning materials or others. 

• Fluency: Where you can identify and prioritise the level of importance of relevant Patterns consistently in all situations without reference or support, and communicate about your perspective e.ectively to di.erent people in di.erent contexts. 




This learning resource is designed to support the attainment of: 
• Competency in the use of the Source Pattern and its three dimensions. 

• Familiarity with the other 6 First Order Patters: Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity, and Dynamics. 




 
 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
 
Learning Method 
 
Learning to think holistically about the dynamic patterns of organisation in systems requires a di.erent type of learning practice. This is di.erent to how we usually learn about the parts of those systems. In PatternDynamics™ training you will notice: 
• a lot of repetition. 

• a very similar pattern of explanation in each Pattern module. 

• multiple closely related examples and ways of exploring each Pattern. 


The reason for this is that learning to ‘see’ patterns of organisation in systems requires that we look at each one from multiple perspectives, in multiple contexts, and in a repeated fashion. The di.erent types of learning content and practices that support this approach include: 
• written material 

• videos 

• graphic symbols and charts 

• exercises to practice in everyday life and work 

• examples of Patterns in di.erent contexts 

• embodies exercises that include movement and group practice

Learning Design 
The PatternDynamics™ learning system (learning praxis) is designed to start simply and to build step by step towards more complex skills and understandings. 
• Introduction: The Source Course • We get started by learning about Source, the most central Pattern in the PatternDynamics™ system, and how to apply it simply and easily to get immediate results in your own life.

• Level 1: • Then we move on to learn the other 6 First Order Patters, which form Aspects of Source. This provides a foundation for systems thinking skills and applications. 




• Level 2: • Next we learn the 49 Second Order Patterns and how to use them as an integrated system for more advanced systems thinking and to help others learn introductory PatternDynamics™ skills. 




• Level 3: • The final stage helps practitioners to use the total system of 56 Patterns, to craft their application e.ectively for di.erent contexts, and to use them fluently to support the development of systems thinking skills in others such as decision making and complex problem solving.

Recommendations 
 
 
• Get in the habit of trying to identify the purpose (Source) of issues that arise in your life and work. 

• Regularly evaluate the e.ects of how you and others are thinking about these issues in terms of the three dimensions of Source. • Draw the Source Pattern on a piece of paper or a white board and place the three sliders under it. Label them: • Part/Whole

• Mark where you think your perspective lies on each slider. Make this a regular habit and reflect on how it changes your thinking about issues that arise and your ability to communicate how you feel about them. • Reflection through journalling, blogging, or other writing will be particularly e.ective.

PatternDynamics™ Decision Making Practice 
 
 
Learning the meaning of the Patterns provides the central content of PatternDynamics™ applications. There are multiple possibilities for the application of PatternDynamics™ content. Two foundation applications are to decision making and complex problem solving. Applications like this form the process components of PatternDynamics™ practice. We will progressively outline the initial components of the PatternDynamics™ Decision Making methodology below: 
• Perspective Mapping • The practice of identifying the Patterns in relation to di.erent perspectives on issues and evaluating where they fall on a continuum of their expression. 

• For instance this is what you are doing when you use the Source Course practice. Although we did not make it explicit in the course, what you are actually doing when you place markers on the sliders is mapping a perspective by identifying it and drawing a representation (or a map) of how it is expressed.

PatternDynamics™ Decision Making Practice 
 
 
 
Decision Making Step 1 
• Source Tracking • Checking to see if the issue is related strongly enough to the ultimate purpose or Source of your group or organisation to merit continued decision making e.ort. 




• Perspective Mapping 

• Perspective Coordination • Undertaking reflective thinking or conversations about mapped perspectives (points of view) with an attitude of curiosity and inquiry in order to discover what each perspective is contributing to a more wholistic picture.

PatternDynamics™ Decision Making Practice 
 
 
Decision Making Step 2 
• Tension Sensing • Becoming skilled at sensing when an important issue is emerging in an unfolding situation. • Can be sensed using our bodily sensations, emotional states, mental activity, and intuition. 







• Source Tracking 

• Perspective Mapping 

• Perspective Coordination 

• Systems Thinking • Using the 7 First Order Patters in the PatternDynamics™ Framework to identify multiple patterns of organisation in a given situation and then use these perspectives as additional perspectives to coordinate.

‘Source’ represents the ‘drive to thrive’. 
 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
 
‘Source’ represents the ‘drive to thrive’ 
 
In the PatternDynamics™ framework Source is the foundational, universal pattern of self- organisation at the heart of all systems. 
 
Each and every system in the universe is a unique expression of Source. 
 
More specifically Source signifies the quality of the collective awareness of the expression of a given system’s unique identity and purpose–or what could be thought of as the ongoing evolution of its ‘source code’–and how that awareness affects the strength of its self- organising capacity. 
 
When awareness of a system’s identity and purpose is co-created, widespread, clear, and present, the parts of that system can better identify and commit to aligned roles that strengthen that system’s core self-organising pattern, or Source. 
 
All systems in nature have clear patterns that form the same atoms, molecules and cells into different dynamic, self-organising entities. For instance, biological systems as diverse as various types of plants, animals, and even whole ecosystems all have distinct identities and roles that evolve over time to adapt successfully to changing circumstances. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
 
 
•How does the evolution of a system’s role or purpose affect the organization of the parts of that system? 
 
•Think about what it means when an organization makes changes to its source code– its core identity and purpose, and therefor its role within the greater scheme of things. 
 
•How does this affect the awareness of what the organization is, who it attracts, and their level of commitment? If it is a radical change, will members still identify strongly enough with the organisation to participate fully and effectively? 
 
•Will its clients and suppliers? 
 
•If an organization does not change at all, will it remain relevant as things change around it? 
 
•Have you been part of a group response to an emergency? 
 
•What was the strength of the collective awareness of the identity and purpose of that group? 
 
•How did it affect self-organizing capacity? 
 
•How could you balance Source or integrate it more fully into a system in your life to improve how it is organized?

Description 
Significance: The Source Pattern represents the quality of the collective awareness of the ongoing evolution that forms a system’s essential nature, or source code. 
 
Role: The role of Source is to serve as the core collective inquiry process that generates awareness of the ongoing expressions of a system’s essential nature: “What is the origin and evolution our identity and purpose?” 
Effect: Source demonstrates the power of collective inquiry to generate awareness that strengthens the self- organising drive all systems have to co-create the conditions that allow them to thrive. 
Balance: Source must be balanced so that, on the one hand, a strong connection is maintained to the origin of a system’s identity and purpose; but, on the other hand, an strong inquiry is maintained that allows that same identity and purpose to evolve in a way that helps it thrive under changing circumstances. 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
Pattern 
The Source Pattern signifies the three primordial dimensions of Source as an ongoing inquiry. 
 
• The Part and the Whole: The two inner shapes denote ‘parts’ that are encompassed by the larger oval into a ‘whole’ system. o “What is the effect on the part vs the whole?” 





 
. The Short Term and the Long Term: The figure of eight shape represents the infinity of the unfolding of time while the encompassing oval signifies the shorter cycles within it. o “What is the effect on the short term vs the long term?” 





 
. The Tangible and the Intangible: The lines of the Pattern represent the easily seen, tangible aspects of systems while the white spaces in and around the lines signify the less tangible spaces that defines them. o “What is the effect on the tangible vs the intangible?”

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Organism: The first complex (eukaryotic) cells evolved as a new pattern of organization of already existing simpler (prokaryotic) cells and bacteria. The purpose of this new symbiosis was to create a system in which each of the elements does better as part of the system than as a lone individual. Within the identity of the eukaryotic cell some of the bacteria adapted to become the power plants (mitochondria) and some adapted to become organelles that capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy (chloroplasts). 
 
Inquiry: How did the co-creation of the eukaryotic cell system help create the conditions for its elements to thrive? Did this evolution of the cell pattern contribute to the greater ability of the biosphere, as a whole, to thrive and evolve? 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Examples 
 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Lichen colonies are formed through a symbiotic relationship between fungi and green algae. Both a fungus and an alga have different patterns of organisation as independent organisms. When in relationship their joint form is distinct and identifiable as a lichen. Through the symbiotic organisation of the lichen form they are able to colonize harsh environments like desert where they exude compounds that stabilize the shifting sands so seeds of higher plants can germinate. If conditions are suitable the’ parts’ of the lichen system may revert to their original identities as fungi and algae respectively. 
 
Inquiry: How does the co-creation of the lichen pattern of organization create the conditions for other organisms to build a more complex ecological system?

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Organizations: The clear identity and purpose of an organic farming operation is to farm without harmful chemicals so that it may provide healthy food, nurture healthy soils, and sustain ecosystems. Its clear identity and purpose and its suitability for repairing degraded environmental conditions has assisted organics to become one of the fastest growing industries on the planet. 
 
Inquiry: Has the identity and purpose of the organics industry evolved since its inception? If so how has this affected different types of consumers in the organics industry?

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Socio-Economic Systems: A community credit union lends money to and takes deposits from local people and businesses only, clearly contrasting it with the identity and purpose of commercial banks which operate a much wider range of financial services over much larger geographical areas. The dilution of larger banking institutions’ identities and purposes as they diversified into insurance and the brokering of financial derivatives has fuelled their short term growth, but may have made them unstable, undermining their long term viability. 
 
Inquiry: Is there a relationship between the radical changes in the identity and purpose of some larger banking institutions and the behaviour by individuals within them that has destabilized them?

‘Rhythm’ signifies the waves and cycles of a system 
 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
‘Rhythm’ represents the waves and cycles of a system. 
All natural systems have regular repetitions and cycles that order events over time. The most important ecological cycle is the annual changing of the seasons caused by the tilt in the earth’s axis relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. The moon causes ocean tides to ebb and flow with a complex monthly rhythm. This rhythm is in turn overlaid with the pulse of waves caused by the wind. Both the seasons and the tides coordinate biological activities, fertility cycles, resource pulses, and a host of other natural rhythms. 
• What role do rhythms play within a system? 

• Think about how having holidays at irregular and random times from year to year would affect the organization of your workplace. 

• What would happen if there was never any variation to the routine? 

• Does your household function better when your family’s weekly routine is regular and uninterrupted? 

• How could you balance an existing Rhythm or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve how it is organized? 

• How do rhythms serve to coordinate systems?

Description 
Significance: The Rhythm Pattern represents the repetitions, swings, pulses, synchronizations and other regularities of processes that characterize a system’s unfolding in time. 
 
Role: The role of Rhythm is to coordinate elements and events in time. 
 
Effect: Rhythm demonstrates the effectiveness of regular patterns in time that assist elements of a system to engage in coordinated processes. 
 
Balance: Rhythms must be balanced so that, on the one hand, their regularity does not become fixed, which may cause problems if conditions require change; or, on the other hand, change too often or too quickly, which can pose unnecessary or costly adaptive challenges for the rest of the system.

Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Organism: All life forms have rhythms of activity that vary in order to support the health of that organism. Respiration in animals is a good example of a Rhythm that serves to coordinate the activity of the entire organism in order to keep it healthy. If the Rhythm of respiration is too slow the animal will not have enough oxygen to drive metabolic processes, but if it is too fast it may cause hyperventilation – the loss of too much carbon dioxide from the blood and a resultant loss of blood pressure. 
Inquiry: What would happen to an organism that was being pursued by a predator if it did not increase its rate of respiration as it increased its physical activity to escape?

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Humans have intervened in natural forest fire cycles by introducing smaller, but more frequent fires. This keeps the fuel load from building up to the point where there are large, but infrequent, hot fires that may destroy property. Changing the Rhythm of fire frequency has other wider effects on the ecosystem, including changing species composition of both plants and animals, altering soil conditions and changing predator/prey relationships. 
Inquiry: If fire Rhythms are changed from erratic natural fire frequencies and sizes to more regular and smaller burns managed by humans, could this change the amount of total soil carbon?

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Organizations: Businesses have financial reporting cycles that influence rhythms within the business like capital expenditures, investment strategies, and wage level adjustments. In most cases annual reporting is sufficient, but if a business is undergoing a period of rapid growth or change it may be necessary to do more frequent financial analysis in order to keep the business healthy. 
Inquiry: What effects might it have on a business if business conditions remain the same, but it diminishes the regularity of its financial reporting?

Socio-Economic Systems: All scales of financial economies throughout history have displayed extremities and irregularities in their levels of activity that have posed challenges for the sustainability of those economies. This is referred to as a ‘boom and bust‘ dynamic. Governments and financial institutions regularly intervene to try and moderate extreme swings in financial activities and to introduce more reliability into the rhythms of financial markets. 
Inquiry: Is it possible to mitigate the extremities of the boom and bust cycle in financial economies thought adjusting fiscal and monetary policy?

‘Polarity’ signifies the relationship between opposites. 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
‘Polarity’ represents the relationship between opposites. 
All natural systems have opposing elements and dynamics that are really just two sides of one thing. Growth and decay in biological systems are two interdependent aspects of the cycle of life. Although they seem like opposing processes, one cannot exist without the other. They are necessary compliments. 
 
• What role do polarities play within systems? 


 
• Think about what your workplace would be like if everyone spent all their time communicating and no time actually acting to get things done. 


 
• Think also about the opposite scenario where only action was prioritized and no one communicated to anyone else. 


 
• How does the more masculine drive to get things done interact with the more feminine tendency to discuss how that should happen? 


 
• Does an organisation that needs to make a big decision about its future direction need to prioritize a more masculine or a more feminine approach? 


 
• How could you balance an existing Polarity or integrate a new one into a system in your life to improve it? 


 
• How do polarities serve to coordinate systems?

Significance: The Polarity Pattern represents opposing forces as two ends of a continuum in dynamic interplay. 
 
Role: The role of Polarity is to build and liberate the potential within systems. 
 
Effect: The relationship between polarities stores potential and their integration liberates energies that drive the activity of systems. 
 
Balance: On the one hand, Polarities must be integrated to take advantage of both approaches, but, on the other hand, they must also be maintained to build potential.

Organism: All organisms must balance the relationship between inputs to their system and the outputs from their system. If an organism is growing then its inputs of nutrients need to exceed its output of wastes. If conditions change in the environment and nutrients for that organism become scarce it must then adjust so that outputs exceed inputs, allowing it to sHRink and survive.

Ecosystem: The interplay between periods of orderly growth and the chaotic bush fires in northern boreal forests is a major planetary regulator of oxygen levels, and by extension the maintenance of atmospheric conditions favourable to life. If the forests do not burn when oxygen levels become high then less fire adapted ecosystems will ignite. If boreal forests were to continue to burn when oxygen levels are low some organisms may struggle to respire.

Organization: The interplay between the more feminine capacity for connection and relationship and the more masculine capacity for individuality and achievement provides a potential within an organization for outcomes not able to be attained by either extreme of the polarity alone. A relational approach facilitates good communications and good decision making, but a capacity for achievement is necessary to enact the decisions made through those good communications.

Economy: The economy is potentiated by the dynamic relationship between cooperation within enterprises and competition with outside rivals. Competition leads to productivity and efficiency gains, but unless it is integrated with cooperation it may become a negative force, creating hyper-individualism and social breakdown. Cooperation creates synergies, but unless it is integrated with competition it leads to a loss of drive by high performing individuals necessary for a strong economy.

www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
‘Structure’ represents bones of the system. 
All natural systems have frameworks that provide relatively fixed and unchanging support structures for more dynamic aspects of the system. Forests are based on the tall, enduring biological structure of trees. Higher animals have strong bone skeletons and lower animals like insects have rigid exoskeletons. Even relatively soft biological cells have cytoskeletons that maintain their structural integrity. 
 
• What role do structures play within a system? 


 
• Think about what an organization would be like if its legal frameworks changed frequently or were removed altogether. 


 
• Think also about what it would be like if these legal frameworks never changed and remained the same now as they were hundreds of years ago.

Organism: All higher animals have interior structural frameworks called skeletons. Their job is to provide support for the rest of the components of the body. If the bones of a creature’s skeleton become too brittle and lose all flexibility, they may break too easily. If bones are too flexible and soft they will not be able to support the weight of the other elements of the body. 
 
Inquiry: Is it a problem when bones lack an ability to flex enough to absorb and adjust to everyday stresses?

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Mangrove trees are the central structural element in tidal wetlands. They hold the shifting sands and sediments in place with their multi-stalked aerial root systems. Mangrove trees have evolved to provide enough structure to hold the more mobile components of the ecosystem in place, but they are not so rigid that they cannot flex in high winds or with tidal currents.

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
Organisation: Companies are governed by organisational structures called constitutions. These documents provide the enduring framework of rules and regulations that shareholders, directors and executives agree to follow in participating in the dynamic operation of the business. If the corporate constitution changes too frequently or radically it may undermine the integrity of the agreements that allow people to work together effectively. If it is too rigid and does not possess the capacity for reasonable exceptions or small adjustments over time, the business may not be able to adapt to changing circumstances. 
Inquiry: Should it generally be easy or hard to make changes to a company’s constitution?

Economy: All modern economies measure the level and success of their activities through financial frameworks called accounting systems. If accounting structures are changed arbitrarily or without good reason, it can lead to inaccurate financial reporting, misallocation of resources, and fraud. If accounting frameworks are too static and they are not changed at all over time, they may become irrelevant in an evolving economy.

www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
‘Exchange’ signifies the productive capacity of systems. 
 
 
All natural systems have productive processes driven by specialized elements exchanging energy and materials with each other. Flowers distribute nectar as a natural energy product in an exchange with insects and animals that do the work of distributing the plant’s pollen. This is a more efficient and therefore more productive outcome than if the flower had to organize its own pollination and the insects and animals had to photosynthesize their own sugars from sunlight energy. 
 
• What role do exchanges play within a system? 


 
• Think about what an organisation would be like if it did not have a unique role within the economy that allowed it to create products or services competitively so as to become a desirable trading partner. 


 
• What would a business be like that tried to be an extreme generalist and work in a multitude of unrelated industries? 


 
• Alternatively, what would it be like to be so highly specialized that your role was only infrequently required within an organisation? 


 
• How do you choose the appropriate level of specialization? How does trade amongst specialists make everybody better off?

Description 
 
Significance: The Exchange Pattern represents the material, energetic and informational trades made between specialized elements of a system. 
Role: The role of Exchange is to provide the production and efficiency gains of systems. 
 
Effect: Exchanges between elements with unique capabilities demonstrates the productivity and efficiency gains of systems that allows them to outcompete any group of non-specialized, non-trading elements. 
Balance: Exchanges must be balanced so that, one the one hand, elements within a system specialize enough that through trade the system gains a competitive advantage; but, on the other hand, elements retain the ability to cover off more than one function so as to ensure resilience.

Organism: The major organs, which act as sub systems within animals’ bodies, specialize in unique capacities: hormone regulation by the endocrine system, filtration by the kidneys, pumping blood by the heart, and gaseous interchange by the lungs–to name but a few. Organs have evolved specializations that allow them to enter into relational exchanges as part of a greater system, but many are not so highly specialized that they cannot cover off the function of other organs. For instance the kidneys and heart have secondary endocrine functions supporting hormone regulation in the body. 
 
Inquiry: What purpose does it serve to have something like endocrine function covered by more than one element in the body?

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Specialized fungi translocate mineral elements through the soil and deliver them to the roots of plants where they are exchanged for sugars produced in the plant’s leaves. If a fungus specializes to the degree where it can exchange with only one species of plant it may become very efficient, but if its plant partner disappears so will the fungus. If the fungus is less specialized and has a generalized capacity to trade with many species it may not be maximally efficient, but it will be more resilient to changes in plant distributions.

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Organizations: Specialist employees exchange skills like accounting, management, trade skills, and IT expertise in order to create productive business systems. If the employees are so highly specialized that they do not understand enough about other roles within the business to relate to them, or in a pinch fill in for them, then specialization may have gone too far. If employees and managers are too general in their abilities, tasks may be covered off by a number of people, but they will not be done with maximum levels of expertise or productivity. 
 
Inquiry: In different kinds of organization is it appropriate to have differing levels of the degree to which people specialize in their skills? If so, why? 
 
 
 
www.patterndynamics.net  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Socio-Economic Systems: Economies are composed of individuals, businesses and whole industries that develop unique capacities and then trade to form a multi-scaled system of exchange. Highly specialized businesses and institutions are needed as economies grow more complex, but high specialization makes business vulnerable to market changes that marginalize the demand for their unique goods or services. All businesses in an economic system must find the balance between high specialization that brings productivity gains and more general capacities that allow them to adapt to changing circumstances. 
 
Inquiry: In a period of volatile and uncertain market conditions should a business increase its specialization to drive productivity or increase its adaptive ability by investing in the ability to produce a more flexible range of products?

‘Creativity’ represents the emergence of new forms within a system. 
 
All natural systems display the capacity for creative evolution in response to changes in the conditions around them. Animals that camouflage themselves to mimic their environment must evolve their strategies as the landscape around them changes. Plant species will continually evolve new forms of protection as their predators evolve to overcome previous protective strategies.

Organism: Organisms as diverse as viruses and mammals show both minor adaptations to temporary changes in things like moisture availability and major evolutionary leaps to accommodate greater changed circumstances, such as climate change. Any organism that places a large emphasis on experimental adaptations risks expending too much energy innovating. This will compromise existing productivity. 
On the other hand, organisms that do not adapt at all, 
or too slowly, will be out-competed by organisms that adapt to fit the changing circumstances better.

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Forest ecosystems display adaptive responses that allow them to recover from disturbances as diverse as wind tHRow, landslip, human harvesting, pest infestation, and fire. If conditions like human harvesting place a greater imperative to adapt to disturbance than the forest can manage, it may be replaced by another vegetation type more suited to that type of disturbance. Alternatively, if forest ecosystems are protected by humans from the cycles of disturbance to which they have adapted, like fire, they may lose their natural vigour and become prone to attack by things they are not adapted to, like pests and disease normally held in check by fire events.

Organizations: All organisations must balance the rate of change to their operational systems. If changes are made too frequently and speculatively the energy spent by members adapting to the new changes and the energy required to repair failures may compromise the health of the organisation. If changes are not made frequently enough the organisation may become dysfunctional by virtue of being out of step with the world around it.

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Socio-Economic Systems: If governments make large or frequent changes to tax law without consulting industry and without giving enough notice of changes, business may find it difficult and resource intensive to adapt to the new fiscal conditions. If government regulators are slow to change tax law to fit with changed economic conditions then it may have an equally disruptive effect because tax revenue may not be being collected effectively enough to support the institutions required for a robust economy. 
Inquiry: Can you think of an example where changes to tax law made it very difficult for some business to adapt quickly enough to survive?

‘Dynamics’ signifies the coordination of processes at the systems level. 
 
All natural systems have processes that integrate dynamics at the systems level. In terrestrial ecosystems fire events can cause changes in species composition that favor more future fire events, starting a positive feedback loop that amplifies fire frequency. Small adjustments over many iterative cycles can lead systems to adapt considerably over time to events like climate change or soil fertility decreases.

Description 
 
Significance: The Dynamics Pattern represents integration, coordination, and control at the systems level itself. 
Role: The role of Dynamics is to provide highly leveraged means for integrating, coordinating and controlling systems level operations that support the attainment of goals. 
Effect: Dynamics demonstrates the often very highly leveraged effects of integrations, coordination, and control at the systems level. 
Balance: Dynamics must be balanced so that, on the one hand, integration, coordination, and control processes are effectively leveraged for meeting goals; but, on the other hand, care must be taken not to apply too much leverage causing systems dynamics to be tHRown out of control.

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Organism: The human nervous system is constantly taking measurements of ambient temperature, which then feed back to adjust activity levels and the body’s overall metabolic rate. If the iteration period of cycles of adjustment is left too long the system will swing wildly from extreme to extreme. If the cycles are too frequent the system will become stressed from the constant activity of adjustment. 
Inquiry: What would happen if the body’s ability to measure ambient temperature was faulty and it increased metabolic activity when ambient temperatures rose?

Examples 
 
Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere 
 
Ecosystem: Coral Reefs are formed by a symbiotic relationship between a calcium carbonate secreting polyp and a photosynthetic algae, which lives within its tissues. 
This dynamic synergy allows these tiny creatures to build 
vast reef systems. If the individual organisms give up too much autonomy the reef system will lose adaptability. If the different organisms do not cooperate fully enough a reef system will not be possible. 
 
Inquiry: How does the level of integration at the level of the reef system itself determine the ongoing viability of the greater marine ecosystem it supports.

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Organizations: Incremental adjustments to a business’s core operating system over many cycles may help improve organisational performance. If the adjustments to the system in each iteration are too large, too much energy is used up in making adjustments and not enough is available for productive activity. If the adjustments are smaller the organisation may be more stable, but lose market share over time as competitors evolve more rapidly. 
Inquiry: What are factors in determining how much to use the lever of iterative change on an organisational system?

Examples 
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems 
 
Socio-Economic Systems: Central banking institutions provide feedback that adjusts the rate of growth in the economy through the manipulation of interest rates. If the central bank cuts prime lending rates too much the economy will overheat as businesses borrow money and expand their operations. If the bank is too slow to cut rates during a slowdown the economy may go into recession. 
Inquiry: Have interest rate controls ever caused overcorrections in the economy?

The Agency/Communion Pattern signifies the tension between integration and disintegration. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. Agency/Communion demonstrates the interplay between the dynamic processes of boundary formation, which integrates parts into wholes, and the dissolution of boundaries which dis-integrate wholes into constituent parts. The rate of boundary formation and dissolution needs to be balanced with the strength of the requirement to work individually as parts or communally as wholes. The role of Agency/Communion is the creation and dissolution of systems. 
Principle: 
The principle of formative boundaries: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of boundary formation and boundary dissolution, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Synergy Pattern signifies a benefit through combination. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. Synergy illustrates the dynamic structural coupling that leads to the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Synergetic integrations must be balanced with the loss of functional diversity. The role of Synergy is to provide a functional multiplier. 
Principle: 
The principle of structural integration: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the synergies of dynamic structural integration and the diversity of function, for a given context. 
   



 
Feedback 
Adjustment Dynamics 
Spontaneity 
Dynamic Response 
 
Description: 
The Feedback Pattern signifies dynamic adjustments. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. Feedback illustrates any process that acts on itself to either increase or decrease an activity level through 
a causal loop. The rate and strength of feedback looping needs to be balanced with the level of adjustment required. The role of Feedback is to make dynamic adjustments. 
Principle: 
The principle of causal loops: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the amount of feedback with the size of adjustments, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Spontaneity Pattern signifies coordinated impromptu reaction. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. Spontaneity 
demonstrates an instantaneous improvisation creating a novel movement or departure that meets a challenge. Spontaneous creative acts need 
to be balanced with the level of stimulus provoking them. The role of Spontaneity is seamless dynamic adaptation. 
Principle: 
The principle of impromptu adaptations: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of spontaneous reactions with the size and type system perturbations, for a given context. 
  


 
System 
Integrated Dynamics 
Harmony 
Unity Dynamics 
 
Description: 
The System Pattern signifies the ordered activity of a synergistic whole. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. System illustrates the cycles of activity supported by structures, polarities, rhythms, creative emergence, and relational exchanges of any integrated group of parts forming a dynamically ordered whole. Repeated integrated processes need to be balanced with aspects of randomness. The role of Systems is to maintain complex dynamic order. 
Principle: 
The principle of dynamic order: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of complex dynamic order and instances of randomness, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Harmony Pattern signifies unified action. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Dynamics. Harmony demonstrates the complete coordination of the processes of a system. Harmony needs to be balanced with the breakdown of order that allows for the establishment of new systems. The role of harmony is to coordinate systems at the highest level. 
Principle: 
The principle of unified action: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of dynamic unity and the breakdown of order, for a given context.

Energy 




Ground Transformations 


Description: 
The Energy Pattern represents the fundamental animating force of reality. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Energy is a measure of the foundational rhythmic vibration exerting a force on entities in the space/ time field and the subsequent qualitative transformations and changes it induces. Energy use must be balanced with its availability. The role of Energy is to drive dynamic change and transformation processes that enable complex order within systems. 








Principle: 
The principle of dynamic transformation: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of energy use in driving changes in organisational complexity and its availability, for a given context. 


  


 
Resource 
Source Distinctions 
Transformity 
Order Accrural 
 
Description: 
The Resource Pattern signifies the process of transformation of matter/ energy. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Resource demonstrates the conservation of the quantity of energy as it transforms into different forms ‘re’ the source. The number of transformations away from the origin or source must be balanced with the usefulness of the transformational form. The role of transformation is to provide different qualities of matter/ energy for unique purposes. 
Principle: 
The principle of source transformations: the enduring health and evolution of any system is depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the number of transformations and the usefulness of the new form, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Transformity Pattern represtents qualitative complexification. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Transformity illustrates the process whereby matter/energy resources are transformed through systemic processes into lesser amounts of matter/energy but higher qualitative complexity within the system. Transformity to higher levels of qualitative complexity and therefore functionality must be balanced with resource availability. The role of Transformity is to bring the advantages of structural increases in order that in turn bring functional increases in performance. 
Principle: 
The principle of complexity creation: the enduring health and evolution of any system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of transformities to higher levels of complexity and available energy, for a given context. 
  


 
Power 
Work Rate 
Autopoiesis 
Self Creation 
 
Description: 
The Power Pattern signifies productivity per unit time. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Power demonstrates the rate and efficiency of systemic functioning that determines if a system will hold its resource flow niche among competitors. Work rate must be balanced 
with the flow rate and reliability of the available resource stream. The role of Power is to provide systemic productivity. 
Principle: 
The principle of productivity rates: the enduring health and evolution of any system requires the appropriate balance and integration of work rate and resource flow, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Autopoiesis Pattern signifies ongoing self-authoring. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Autopoiesis demonstrates the maintenance and creative unfolding of a system’s unique form and function as it continues to develop. The rate of the self-creating process must be balanced with basic self-maintenance. The role of Autopoiesis is to maintain a unique system of order through creative growth. 
Principle: 
The principle of creative existence: the enduring health and evolution of any system requires the appropriate balance and integration self- development and self maintenance, for a given context. 
  


 
Pattern 
Dynamic Order 
Void 
Ground Source 
 
Description: 
The Pattern Pattern signifies repeated types of order. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Pattern illustrates recurrent design arrangements that order parts into particular styles of dynamically 
functioning forms. Restrictive patterns of recurrent dynamically unfolding order need to be balanced with unordered states with high potential for new arrangements. The role of Pattern is to provide successful templates of systemic design. 
Principle: 
The principle of potential and restrictiveness of form: the enduring health and evolution of any system requires the appropriate balance and integration of restrictive highly patterned forms and unrestricted states of low order, but high potential, for a given context. 
Description: 
The Void Pattern signifies the foundational ground of universal matter/ energy consciousness from which complex ordering unfolds. It is a Second Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Void illustrates the field of sentient 
awareness required as the non dual complement to matter/energy in the creation of complex systems of order. Fields of concentrated awareness experienced by entities with complex patterning must be balanced with more diffuse manifestations of consciousness available to less ordered entities. The role of Void is to signify the consciousness necessary for order. 
Principle: 
The principle of conscious order: the enduring health and evolution of any systems depends on the appropriate balance and integration of concentrated expressions of consciousness associated with complex systems architectures and diffuse expressions of consciousness associated with less complex forms of order, for a given context. 

 
The Source Course 

 
 
Use this exercise to get started with a simple, but powerful, systems thinking principle that will assist you with better decision making. 
Source is related to your ultimate purpose as an organization. When it is co-created, widespread, clear, and present it forms a central organizing principle of that system. The Goal of this exercise is to help you reflect on three foundational dimensions of your organization’s Source. Reflecting on them will help you think more deeply about the reasons behind your thinking. Thinking about your reasoning in this way helps identify some important systems principles that provide insights for better decision making. 
Instructions: Choose a topic or issue that is important to you and record it on the line below. Read the descriptions of the three dimensions of Source listed on the next page. See if you can place an ‘X’ on each slider bar that indicates how you (or another) is thinking about this issue Lastly, in the boxes below each description, write some reflections on why you placed the ‘X’s where you did on each bar.

Part/Whole: All systems are composed of a series of parts that come together to form an integrated whole. Does your thinking (or another’s) relate more strongly to outcomes for a part of your organization or more to results for the organization as a whole? See if you can draw an ‘X’ on the Part/Whole slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities.

Short Term/Long Term: To function optimally all systems must balance achieving short term outcomes with long term goals. Does your thinking (or another’s) relate more strongly to achieving short term outcomes or more to working towards long term aims and objectives? See if you can draw an ‘X’ on the Short Term/Long Term slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities.

How Mass Self-Organisation Changes Everything 
 
 
Self-organisation depends, more than anything else, on developing the quality and richness of our relationships. 

 
It’s as simple as starting there. The great misunderstanding and the great flaw in our currently dominant, mechanistic world-view is that we should focus on ‘the system’–out there. Too often that’s a distraction from what really matters and what’s harder to contemplate, but ultimately more rewarding–changing what’s inside of us so that we are able to change what is between us. Learning to create better relationships is the most reliable, and some would say the only, way to really change our systems for the better. 
 
Facilitating more widely distributed self-organising capacity must be one of the central strategies for managing the challenges of an increasingly complex world. At PatternDynamicsTM we can help you develop skills for doing that. You can get started with this Workbook. But, self-organisation skills are not primarily tools for ‘managing’ groups or organisations (although they can help), they are, first and foremost, an opportunity to grow by spreading the artistry and science of creating deeper connections. 
 
That is the real reason mass self-organisation changes everything.

The Living Systems View 
Living systems work like flocks of birds. They are self-organising: the coordination of the whole emerges, bottom-up, from the combined interactions of all members of the group. In a living systems model, individuals make autonomous decisions based on sharing a set of organising principles. In the case of a flock of birds, they are principles like know the goal, turn when your neighbour turns, maintain a certain distance to the birds nearby, and follow the bird in front of you. The parts that make up all living systems, from organisms to whole ecosystems, form relationships and self-organise in this way. 
 
In contrast to the living systems model, many organisations are based on a mechanistic view. In mechanistic models, decision making comes from the top down. Individuals are expected to carry out decisions in a highly structured fashion, like the cogs or springs in a clock. Research indicates that as organisational challenges become more complex, mechanistic operating models do not allow sufficient collective input for effective decision making and problem solving. 1 
 
Our goal in this workbook is to provide you with a model that helps you learn principles, practices, and skills for demonstrating the benefits of increased self-organisation based on a living system view. By demonstrating these benefits you can attract others to this form of organisational practice and help lead the change to more generative cultures.

The 7 Principles of Self-Organisation 
You can get started very simply. Remember how birds use principles to decide what to do next? You can do the same thing. Just use the 7 Principles of Self-Organisation below to reflect on your decision making as challenges arise. Notice that in applying each principle there is an opportunity to develop your relationships. In the following sections of this Workbook, you will have the opportunity to learn about the principles in more depth and to apply them as more detailed practices. For now, just imagine that, like a flock of birds, deciding on adjustments based on these living systems principles will contribute to emergent solutions. 
 
 

1) Feel Into Your Rhythms: 
 Do your important rhythms and routines feel right? Is there anything that could be more regular, or less? 
 

2) Locate Important Perspectives: 
 Have you found all the important sources of information? Who do you need to talk to to locate relevant points of view? 
 

3) Outline Organisational Structures: Are key organisational structures represented as simple graphics? 
How could you update your organisational charts? 
 

4) Coordinate Diverse Perspectives: 
 How could you learn more by exchanging perspectives? What priorities may need to be adjusted? 
 

5) Design Creative Solutions: 
 What are some ways you could connect previously unrelated ideas? What novel solutions look like the best ones to test? 
 

6) Reflect on Governance: 
 Are any current goals or milestones outdated? What agreements need to be updated to make them more relevant? 
 

7) Sense Changes In Your Purpose: 
 Do you sense any changes to your purpose? If so, what adjustments could be made in relation to the principles above? 
 

 
 
5 

Ok, But How Does This Actually Work? 
You may have noticed that you do many of these things already–intuitively, without really giving it much thought–and that so do the people around you. Self-Organisation, in the way it is described here, happens all the time. In any group, everyone makes dozens or even hundreds of different decisions, big and small, every day that are essential in order for groups to function well. However, conventional management practices are founded in a mechanistic view, where individuals are passive elements in the use of top-down control. The reality is that people are active participants in a living system and that bottom-up influence is, at least, equally important. 
 
This is the essence of the democratic principle–that participation from the base of a hierarchy matters. PatternDynamics works by empowering effective democratic, bottom-up participation in groups, communities, and organisations. 
 
It does this in a number of key ways that it is useful to think about as you use the 7 Principles: 
• Increases awareness of bottom-up processes by promoting a living systems view. 

• Provides a language to identify and communicate about self-organisation clearly. 

• Prescribes a simple set of principles to work by and to share. 

• Improves collaboration by providing a consistent framework. 

• Encourages a set of practical, embeddable practices that build self-organisation skills. 

• Designed for getting started quickly and sharing easily. 

• Allows individuals to use their own initiative to demonstrate improved self-organisation. 

• Promotes a low-risk transformation strategy that’s designed to spread organically.

Assess Your Capability 

You’d like to gain skills to help your organisation or community shift to a more open, adaptive, innovative self-organising operating model. You understand that the world is becoming more complex, and that this is one of the most effective ways to meet the complexity challenge. 

 
Before we move on to the the PatternDynamicsTM Operating System (PD OS) itself, we’ll start with some reflection on the nature of living systems.The questions in the section that follows will help you: 1) understand the living systems context, 2) evaluate your existing capability, and 3) determine your purpose. 
 
If you are working on this with a team or a group, feel free to bring them into this process. 
 
The Living Systems Context 
On the next page, we’ll go through some reflective questions. As well as helping you understand more about your group or organisation, this assessment will also help you get a sense of some of the important general characteristics of living systems. The characteristics we will focus on are: adaptability, innovation, openness, self-organising capacity, and generativity. 
 
Don’t worry if some of the terms or questions are unfamiliar to you. At PatternDynamics, we have developed a range of resources to help people improve their understanding of how living systems work. How well you understand them at this point will give you a sense of the strength of your existing level of ‘systems thinking’ ability. 

 
 
7 
 
 
Adaptability: How well does your organisation or community mimic a living system’s capability for solving problems at the level best suited to meet a particular challenge? Contrast this with the habit of (and/or requirement for) deferring decisions to those higher up the chain of command.

Now choose a group or team that you work with directly. Assess the group’s general performance in relation to the living systems traits below. Then sit down with a colleague and discuss their views on these topics. 
 
• Openness: How open and inclusive is your group to dissenting, marginal, or outside voices? 


 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 
 
• Self-organisation: How well does this team spontaneously coordinate its activities? 


 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
……………………………………………………………………………………. 
 
• Generativity: How often do people create self-reinforcing cycles that build healthier, more functional environments that in turn support the perpetuation of this cycle? 


 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
……………………………………………………………………………………. 
 
How closely did your colleague’s thoughts match your own? What did you learn about your group’s, and your own, living systems capacity?

Determining Your Purpose 
Why do you want to help your team, organisation, or community shift to a more self- organising operating model? What is your ultimate purpose in facilitating groups that coordinate themselves using living systems principles? 
 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
……………………………………………………………………………………………… 
…………………………………………………………………………. 
 
Reflect for a moment on the impact you could have by adopting more elements of a living systems operating system. What things could you do regularly, even at a small scale, to demonstrate the benefits of more open, adaptive, and innovative processes? What opportunities become available when challenges are met simply and effectively using a more self-organising approach?

Evaluating Your Current State 
Now we’re going to have a look at how you currently perform in your group or organisation. Grade below, as best you can, quickly and intuitively, how you currently behave in relation to the 7 Principles. Be honest. Higher scores indicate better self-organisation skills. You can also use this as a ‘360’ type assessment by asking your colleagues to assess your performances.

Principles, Patterns and Practices 
In order to start using the Operating System (PD OS) itself, you will need to learn more about the 7 Principles by connecting them to their source, the PatternDynamics™ Systems Thinking Framework. 
 
 
The framework is a set of diagrams or symbols called ‘Patterns’. Each Pattern represents a comprehensive description of a living systems principle. It’s these principles, based on observations of natural systems and insights from the systems sciences, that are the origin of the 7 Principles of Self- Organisation. The Patterns will help you learn more about each of the Principles, when to apply them, and how. Deepening your recognition and communication of how living systems are organised is one of the keys to mastery in facilitating self-organisation. 
 
In the Operating System graphic on the previous page, you can see that there is one Pattern associated with each Principle. In the pages that follow, click on a Pattern to view its full description. If you have a printed copy of this Workbook you can go to www.patterndynamics.net/patterns to look them up. 
 
To begin using the PD OS you will also need to develop the Principles into a set of Practices–specific actions you can take to build your skills when faced with decision making and problem solving challenges. 
 
Below is one page for developing each of the 7 Practices. On each page you will find an Overview, 3 Elements of each Practice, its associated Pattern, and an Exercise. Learn, undertake, and reflect on these regularly. You should get benefits as you are practicing each one, but it is when you learn to integrate them into an ongoing adaptive process that you will get the best results. 

 
 
14 
Feel Rhythms 
Get in touch with timing. Having effective routines and cycles is required for optimising the organisation of any group. However, regularity should not be seen as fixed, or an end in itself–rhythms should be adjusted for both regularity and flexibility as required. The practice of Feeling Rhythms has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• Sense Cycles: develop an awareness of repetitions, pulses, swings, and other regularities over time. 


 
• Introduce Routines: introduce regularity into activities when required. 


 
• Adjust Rhythms: find the optimum balance between regularity and flexibility as circumstances change. 


 
 
 
Pattern: 

 
 
Exercise: 
Rhythm is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with the practice of Feeling Rhythms. It reminds us that balancing regularity with flexibility within a system is important for building self-organising capacity. 
 
Feeling Rhythms is an embodied skill that requires the ability to sense tensions in relation to timing. Try this exercise a few times in the coming weeks: Notice when you are feeling either emotionally frustrated or excited about the timing of a group process. Where does this emotion show up in your body? Write down what you think needs to be adjusted and why. How could you increase your sensitivity to both challenges and opportunities in relation to synchronising events better in time? 

 
 
15 
Locate Perspectives 
Engage all relevant points of view. Identifying the important stakeholders is essential for accessing all the information required to meet challenges effectively. Importantly, you must seek to verify any assumptions made about the information they hold. Locating Perspectives has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• Identify Stakeholders: confirm all important stakeholders and sources of information. 


 
• Take Perspectives: prioritise sources and imagine the information they possess. 


 
• Seek Perspectives: engage directly with sources to verify available information. 


 
 
 
Pattern: 

 
 
Exercise: 
Polarity is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with the practice of Locating Perspectives. It reminds us that identifying all the important distinctions (relevant elements) that stand out from the general background is important for building self-organising capacity. 

Locating Perspectives is a perspectival skill that requires the ability to locate distinct points of view, to imagine what they could tells us, and to verify what they actually do tell us. Try this exercise 3 times. Think about a challenge you are facing and list three important stakeholders. Try to choose people who have a wide range of roles in relation to this situation. Imagine what each of them thinks. What happens when you seek to verify what they think? Did you guess accurately? If so, how accurately? If not, how different were your guesses? 
 
 
16 
Outline Structures 
Draw organisational structures. Graphically representing your organisational architecture brings clarity to roles, accountabilities, relationships, and structures. However, it is important to also document where agreed-on authority lies. Outlining Structures has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• List Roles and Accountabilities: record and clarify required roles and their responsibilities. 


 
• Clarify Authorities: verify the nature and scope of the agreed-on authority assigned to each role. 


 
• Draw Structures: create simple, graphic representations of relationships, roles and authorities. 


 
 
Pattern: 

 
 
Exercise: 
Structure is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with Outlining Structures. It reminds us that a clear understanding of a system’s structure is important for building self-organising capacity. 
 
Outlining Structures is a graphic skill that requires the ability to represent organisational architectures, primarily with non-verbal symbols. Try this exercise for three organisations or communities: Use small circles to represent individuals. Use different sized circles to represent different sized groups. Nest circles to show where they are parts of a bigger group. Show relationships by locating circles together or by using connecting lines. Label with words to describe roles and authorities. How is the information contained in your diagrams different from purely written descriptions of the same structures? 

 
 
17 
Coordinate Perspectives 
Use systems thinking to collaborate. Coordinating views, through inquiring to identify principles that locate common ground, minimises conflict and optimises cooperation. This process requires the ability to think well and communicate effectively about the wider system. Coordinating Perspectives has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• Collaborate through Inquiry: use inquiring conversations to build trust and exchange information. 


 
• Use Systems Thinking: think about the wider context and identify principles that unify perspectives. 


 
• Coordinate Perspectives: seek agreement regarding important principles and priorities. 


 
 
Pattern: 

Exchange is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with Coordinating Perspectives. It reminds us that exchanging information and identifying common principles is required for building self-organising capacity. 
 
 
Exercise: 
Coordinating Perspectives is a relational skill that requires the ability to communicate effectively, build trust, identify common themes, and facilitate agreement.Try this exercise three times: Identify a challenge. Ask three people their views on meeting this challenge. Listen only and record. Review your records and try to identify common themes and principles. Hint: The ultimate purpose of a group should always be one such theme. How does searching for the common ground change the way you perceive a situation? 

 
 
18 
Design Decisions 
Make creative connections for design solutions. More effective problem solving requires the creative association and organisation of previously unconnected ideas. However, proposed solutions can only be optimised if you are able to explain the reasoning behind your choices. Designing Decisions has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• Connect Ideas: link your most important ideas to create novel solution prototypes. 


 
• Design Solutions: integrate ideas from prototypes to create and decide on a solution to test. 


 
• Explain Rationale: explain the reasons behind your decision making process. 


 
 
 
Pattern: 

 
 
Exercise: 
Creativity is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with Designing Decisions. It reminds us that making creative connections is important for building self-organising capacity. 
 
Designing Decisions is a design skill. It requires the ability to select important elements and themes related to a challenge, connect them in new ways, create well-designed solutions, and explain your thinking. Try this exercise. Seek multiple perspectives to identify important elements of a challenge. Group like elements into themes. See how many creative connections you can make between elements and themes. List three new ideas that emerge from this process. Has this changed how you think about making decisions? If so, how?

Govern Reflectively 
Review agreements to govern. Self-organising governance is facilitated by collaborating to establish goals and milestones and recording them in transparent agreements. However, governance is optimised only if all parties reflect on these agreements regularly and modify them as required. Reflective Governing has three elements: 
Practice Elements: 
• Set Milestones: co-create agreed on goals and milestones. 


 
• Record Agreements: record roles, accountabilities, tasks and authorities in transparent agreements. 


 
• Review Progress: reflect regularly on progress and modifying agreements as required. 


 
 
Pattern: 

 
 
Exercise: 
Dynamics is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with Governing Reflectively. It reminds us that practicing dynamic steering through reflective leadership is important for building self-organising capacity. 
 
Governing Reflectively is a leadership skill that requires the ability to encourage ongoing, collaborative co- creation and reflection in relation to goals, milestones, and agreements. Do this exercise in relation to three agreements you currently have in place, whether they are explicitly recorded or not. Reflect on what has changed since progress started toward the latest milestones. Have these changes affected your goal? Does your agreement need to be modified to get the best outcome?

Source Sensing 
Maintain awareness of evolving purpose. Having a clear shared purpose is a powerful source of self-organising capacity. However, your purpose will shift and evolve as different challenges help to identify new goals and directions. Source Sensing has three elements: 
 
Practice Elements: 
• Connect to Source: maintain an awareness of the origin and evolution of your purpose and goals. 


 
• Sense Tensions: develop the capacity to sense information pointing to opportunities for change. 


 
• Adjust the System: becoming skilled at sensing when and how to make adjustments. 


 
 
Pattern: 

Source is the PatternDynamicsTM systems thinking principle associated with Source Sensing. It reminds us that being sensitive to emergent challenges and opportunities for change is important for building self-organising capacity. 
 
 
Exercise: 
Source Sensing is an intuitive skill that requires present awareness of sensations, perceptions, emotions, ideas, and narratives. Do this exercise during group discussions. Focus on being relaxed, present, and aware. Make your breathing deep, regular, and slow. What are the subtler kinds of stimuli that you aware of? Try and connect them to tensions in the group that might signal a need for change?

Run the Operating System 
Ok, you’ve got a sense of the living systems view, learned some Principles, been introduced to a set of Patterns, and started to develop some deeper Practices. Now it’s time to take your skill building to the next level and integrate everything you’ve learned. 
 
We’re going to start with a step by step process, but as you become more practiced, you’ll be able to use the PD OS more intuitively. As you head toward mastery, it will serve more as a set of touchstones, enabling your own more spontaneous and fluid interpretations. Even at this stage, though, its a good idea to keep the OS handy as a reference. 
 
Pick a group challenge and work your way through the Health Check Card on page 26. Use the PD Operating Model on a Page, below, as a reference guide and follow the cycle. The performance indicators are: 
 
• Low Performance: where the practice is virtually non existent, poorly understood, and not getting results. 

• Medium Performance: where it’s sometimes used, only partially understood, and getting only limited results. 

• High Performance: where it’s fully integrated, understood by everyone, and getting optimal results. 


 
Continue with repeated cycles of the OS. Work towards high performance (3 points) in each box. Using the Health Check Chart and following the steps in the OS cycle are a great way to get started, but they’re a bit like training wheels–when you’re ready, you’ll want to move beyond them to enjoy a more free flowing experience. 
 
The difference between the PD OS and other more distributed or networked organisational operating systems is that its not primarily a system–it’s a practice. Your colleagues won’t necessarily know about your practice, and if they do, or if others are practicing with you, no one will have to face the disruptions of conforming to a new system. They should just enjoy the benefits as your practice builds better relationships and enhances the group’s natural capacity for self-organisation.

The Source Course 
The Source Course is a simple exercise that will help you, and others, learn to deepen your understanding of this foundational Principle of Self-Organisation. It will also demonstrate how to think about finding the optimal balance for any principle you are working with, in any context. 
 
Source represents a shared primary ethic of fostering generative health. 
 
Its power lies in the fact that generating health–living systems’ unrelenting drive to create the conditions that will support healthier, more enduring living systems–is the deepest inclination of a self-organising universe. 
 
Not only is Source the central organising principle of PatternDynamics itself, it can act as a guiding star for self-organising activity within any group, community, or organisation. 
 
As you will see, to work with Source we need to balance three primary principles of systems health: 
 
• the balance between parts (individuals) and the whole (the collective) 

• the balance between tangible results and intangible value 

• the balance between short term outcomes and long term viability 


 
Follow the instructions on the next page. You can also print and distribute the Source Course pages and do this as a group exercise.

The Source Pattern above signifies the universal organising power of sharing deep collective purpose. The diagram itself represents 3 related foundational living systems principles: 
 
1. The relationship between parts and wholes. • The two inner shapes represent parts of a system (e.g. an individual), the outer oval the whole (e.g. the organisation). 




2. The relationship between tangible results and intangible capital. • The blue lines represent the more tangible aspects of systems (e.g. $) and the white space that defines them, the less tangible value (e.g. trust building). 




3. The relationship between short term outcomes and longer term viability. • the infinity symbol in the middle represents long term horizons (e.g. sustainability of the organisation) and the oval on the outside a shorter single cycle (e.g. immediate results).

3. Write a short, agreed on, statement of the ultimate purpose of your work together, Establish the relevance of meeting this particular challenge to fulfilling your purpose. 

4. Consider each person’s views, on how best to decide how to meet this challenge, in relation to the three principles on the right. 


 
5. Map each team member’s perspective by marking a coloured ‘X’ onto each of the 3 slider bars. Use a di.erent coloured ‘X’ for each person. 


 
6. Determine where to place each person’s Xes using a group discussion to determine if: • the view prioritises a part of the organisation, the whole organisation, or somewhere in between. 

• use the same process in relation to the other two principles. 





 
7. So What? How could reflecting on the di.erent views this way help you to agree on what to prioritise at this time, and what might need to be prioritised at another time?

Finding the Balance 
In the Source Course, you practiced reflecting on the balance of each of Source’s three principles. Learning to recognise the balance represented by a point of view, in relation to a range of different principles of organisation, is a key to attaining mastery in applying the living systems view. 
To continue to develop your practice, see if you can identify how different perspectives are balanced in relation to the Principles represented by the other Patterns in the PD Framework. Click on the ones below for descriptions. Place marks on the sliders until you can sense the balance intuitively, without this supporting activity.

INTRODUCTION  
Enhancing enterprise effectiveness 
All organisations strive for high performance, in the short-term at least. Yet the real ‘holy grail’ is sustainable excellence – even in fast-changing times. 
The usual recommendation for this is an almost obsessive focus on efficiency above everything else. True, an emphasis on efficiency will help in some ways; but the only way to sustain excellence in the long term is through focusing on effectiveness – of which efficiency is only one part. Effectiveness in turn depends on integration, on understanding and working with the enterprise as a whole. How to do so is what this book describes. 
As explained in previous books in this series – such as Real Enterprise Architecture: beyond IT to the whole enterprise (or ‘Real EA’) – developing and maintaining a clear picture of the whole is a key task for the enterprise-architect. Yet this book will also be useful for anyone whose work addresses or encompasses the whole enterprise – senior strategists and analysts, executives and senior management, Programme Management Office and similar roles. And the concepts and techniques described here can be used in any kind of enterprise, at every scale, from a single-person project to a large multi-national corporation or even an entire country. 
Themes we’ll address here include: 
what is enterprise effectiveness? 
what impact does effectiveness have on enterprise performance? 
what impact does strategy have on enterprise effectiveness? 
how can we measure and monitor effectiveness? 
how can we use those metrics to enhance overall effectiveness? 
In other words, a bit of theory to set the context, but the remainder is very much a practical ‘how-to’ – a cook-book that’s seasoned with real-world examples. But first, a simple question with a not-so-simple answer: 
What is effectiveness? 
What is ‘effectiveness’, in an enterprise sense? The usual management texts seem to imply either that effectiveness is the same as efficiency, or else assert that we need to be “efficient and effective” without actually describing what is meant by ‘effective’ or how it differs from efficiency. In other words, ‘effective’ is, well, effective an’ all that, y’know? Which isn’t much help… To enhance enterprise effectiveness, we need something that’s a lot more concrete than that kind of vague, woolly non-definition. 
So let’s be explicit: effectiveness consists of, or arises from, four distinct dimensions, plus another sort-of dimension that ties the others together: 
efficient – makes the best use of available resources 
reliable – can be relied on to deliver the required results 
elegant - supports the human factors in the context 
appropriate – supports and sustains the overall purpose 
integrated - linked to and supports integration of the whole as whole 
Enterprise performance depends on how well we optimise across these dimensions, and the set of related dimensions that, between them, express the enterprise’s ‘ability to do work’. More detail on that in the next chapter; the point here is that efficiency is neither the same as effectiveness, nor separate from it, but a subset of what’s needed for overall effectiveness. 
The danger, then, is that a focus on efficiency alone will almost always cause more harm than good, because we cannot optimise appropriately against the other dimensions of effectiveness. Yet many, perhaps most, of the standard management texts still promote the assumption that efficiency is the be-all-and-end-all of business: what’s going on? The short answer is that they’re using the wrong metaphor to describe the enterprise – which at first might sound somewhat abstract, but the impacts on enterprise capability and performance are all too real. To understand why it’s such a problem, and what to do about it, it’s worthwhile taking a brief detour to look at this matter of metaphor. 
A matter of metaphor 
For more than a century, the most common metaphor to describe the enterprise is to think of it as a machine – more specifically, in the commercial context, as ‘a machine for making money’ on behalf of the shareholders. This is the core concept behind ‘scientific management’, of ‘business process re-engineering’ and so many other theories and models of the enterprise. In my main field of enterprise-architecture, for example, it’s the basis for John Zachman’s oft-repeated assertion that the role of architecture is ‘engineering the enterprise’. And so on, and so on. 
It’s been around so long, and been dominant for so long, that it doesn’t seem like a metaphor at all: it’s the description of how things really are. But despite that sense of certainty, of ‘natural-ness’, in reality it’s just one of many possible metaphors, and by no means the best – in fact, for most present-day enterprises, it’s dangerously misleading. For practical purposes, it’s far better to think of the enterprise as a living organism. The contrast between these two metaphors is striking: 

Machine 
 Living organism 
 

Purpose provided from outside (has no inherent purpose) 
 Purposive, self-motivating 
 

Requires outside agency to adapt for change or repair 
 Self-adapting, self-repairing 
 

Rule-based: cannot cope with complexity 
 Can handle full spectrum of rules, guidelines, heuristics, principles 
 

Sum of its parts 
 May be more (or less) than sum of its parts 
 

Can be taken apart and rebuilt 
 Likely to fail (‘die’) if taken apart 
 

Metaphors: machine versus living organism 
If we view the enterprise as a machine, then our only concerns are efficiency and reliability – hence ‘scientific management’, and its obsession with control. From this perspective, it’s ‘obvious’ that people are ‘human resources’, interchangeable components to be linked into the functions of the machine via standardised job-descriptions. It’s equally ‘obvious’ that, wherever practicable, people should be replaced by software, because (in theory at least) machines are more predictable than people – hence the delusory allure of theories such as business process re-engineering… 
Business process re-engineering has been described as “the last gasp of Taylorism” – the final act of hubris that highlighted all the fundamental flaws in ‘scientific management’. I’ve yet to hear of any BPR project that delivered all its promised benefits: instead, most cases came close to destroying the entire enterprise. 
Some years after the initial exuberant hype, and when the true scale of the debacle had become too much to ignore, one of BPR’s most ardent proponents ruefully admitted that “we failed to take enough account of the human factors”. Hmm… methinks ‘failed to take any account of the human factors’ might have been more accurate… 
For all its appeal, its apparent simplicity, the machine metaphor has some lethal limitations. For example, it assumes a strict separation between ‘brawn’ and ‘brain’ – the classic distinction between ‘blue-collar’ versus ‘white-collar’. And the real thinking for how to reconfigure and restructure the machine must always come from outside – hence lucrative employment for armies of self-styled ‘management consultants’. Yet the catch in doing so is that the ‘brain’ is distanced from the action, hence keeping track of what’s going is always uncertain; communication takes too much time; decisions are always too late; and key details are often lost or misinterpreted, causing decisions to be flawed at best. When the wrong information and other resources arrive in the wrong place, with the wrong person, at the wrong time or in the wrong sequence, life can be hell out there on the factory floor… 
So whilst the machine metaphor is efficient in theory, it’s often appallingly ineffective in practice. (In fact it fails because the focus is theory, not practice – though more on that later.)  The only business-contexts for which it does work well are those with stable, slow-changing markets and simple, highly standardised products or services – which applies to very few enterprises in the present-day. The machine metaphor simply cannot cope with the current global trends, such as growing diversity and division; the need for differentiation in a globalised, commodified market; increasing value of information; outsourcing and other ‘extended enterprise’ relationships; emerging networks, ‘value webs’, and other dynamic consortia; 24 / 7 ‘follow-the-sun’ business-processes, and the ever-increasing pace and complexity of change. 
No doubt, of course, that every enterprise will still need continuous improvements in efficiency, to cope with the relentless pressure to do more with less; and every business system and business 
process will still need reliability, wherever we can find it. Yet most real-world enterprises also need a model that allows for uncertainty and unpredictability, for complexity and rapid change. Which is where the metaphor of the ‘living enterprise’ comes into the picture. 
In a living organism, the ‘brain’ isn’t separate from the ‘brawn’: each is part of and dependent on the other. A large enterprise, just like a large organism, is a complex web of interdependent specialised services woven into a single ‘viable system’; and as systems-theory pioneer Stafford Beer put it, the real ‘brain of the firm’ does not reside solely with the managers, but is distributed throughout the enterprise. The same is true of the enterprise’s knowledge of itself and its environment – the key concerns of enterprise-architecture; these arise from the ‘human factors’, from personal skills, personal knowledge, relationships, purpose, commitment, drive. Such things have no meaning to a machine – but they matter a great deal to a living enterprise. 
Without access to that ‘distributed brain’, the enterprise is likely to be in deep trouble in today’s complex environment; but when that knowledge and awareness and creativity are available, and shared – as Deming proved in his work on quality in post-Second World War Japan – the enterprise becomes self-correcting, self-adapting, self-motivated, able to respond with agility to any changes in needs and context. And thrives as a result. 
Science itself has changed, too: the science underlying Taylorist ‘scientific management’ has long since gone out of date. A present-day ‘scientific management’ would have to extend beyond the crude concepts of control and cause-and-effect, to include new factors such as recursion, complexity and emergent systems. And in most business contexts, it’s not just that those ‘human factors’ do matter: they determine enterprise effectiveness – and the difference between failure and success. 
So whilst the machine metaphor leads us naturally towards a focus on efficiency, it leads us away from effectiveness – and it’s the latter that we really need. Yet however outdated, old meta-phors are hard to drop: thinking in terms of the ‘living enterprise’ may well seem, well, unnatural, for a while at least. But it’s well worth the effort of persisting with that shift in mindset, because there’s a real pay-off in terms of a better understanding of effectiveness, and how to achieve it in practice in the enterprise. 
Principles of intervention design 
Practice is the real concern here. Metaphors may be interesting, but they’re of no use unless we can put them to use. Where ‘the rubber meets the road’ for effectiveness in practice is in the design of diagnostics and interventions that support appropriate change in the enterprise – helping it to become ‘efficient on purpose’. 
I’ll perhaps risk repeating myself too often here, but it’s essential to remember that with the machine metaphor it’s all too easy to be ‘efficient without purpose’ – which in real terms is neither efficient nor effective. 
It’s relatively simple to maximise the efficiency of any one part of ‘the machine’ on its own, as long as we don’t care about the impact anywhere else in the enterprise. It’s not simple to balance the effectiveness-tradeoffs across the entire enterprise, and keep the whole thing on track towards an intended purpose. 
The machine-metaphor beguiles us with that so-desirable delusion that our interventions can provide control over the enterprise – but unfortunately it is a delusion. By contrast, the living-enterprise metaphor illustrates the real complexity of what we’re dealing with. In designing interventions for a real enterprise, in a real context, with real people, the pHRase ‘herding cats’ comes to mind… but at least it is real, which ‘the machine’ is not. 
To the machine-metaphor, the enterprise is simply a scaled-up machine: more and more complicated as it scales in size, but still a machine. So for intervention-design the focus is on ‘fail-safe’, on certainty, on taking control of causes and effects to create the required, predefined outcomes. Or trying to do so, because it’s never really worked… 
Instead, the living-enterprise metaphor accepts that complexity is qualitatively different. In complex systems, such as in any real-world enterprise, there is no certainty; everything is both ‘cause’ and ‘effect’, so there is no such thing as control. There are definite outcomes, and desirable outcomes at that, but nothing that could be determined for certain in advance. So the emphasis in intervention design is not on ‘fail-safe’, but ‘safe-fail’. 
‘Safe-fail’ is about deliberate design to ‘test the waters’, and pull back to a known-safe position if the outcome is not what we want. There is no ‘failure’ as such, because every intervention is an experiment. And because every intervention is also a diagnostic, this means that, as Dave Snowden of Cognitive Edge puts it, the experiments “allow us to test the evolutionary possibilities of the 
system”, extending our knowledge of what works and what doesn’t, within that specific context. 
A simple example here, from quality-systems development. 
In conventional control-based models, the emphasis is on ‘best-practice’ – on replicating exactly what worked well elsewhere. As long as the context is the same as elsewhere, that approach does seem to work – mostly, anyway. 
But in environments where there are many ‘one-offs’ and the context inherently uncertain, a better approach is ‘worst-practice’. For example, maintenance-engineers swap stories of what didn’t work, and the experiments they went through to reach an appropriate solution. 
‘Best practice’ is always a good idea, wherever we can apply it, but it risks failure as soon as the context moves away from what we and it had expected. And in the real world, ultimately everything is a ‘market of one’: there’s always something that’s a little bit different, in everything we do… Both approaches are valid: the trick – the skill – is in knowing which one to use, where, when and why. 
So throughout this book, whenever we talk about intervention-design, it’s not about some kind of attempt to ‘take control’ of this wayward beast we call ‘the enterprise’. Rather, it’s about working with the complexity, often running multiple and sometimes contradictory pilot-projects in parallel, to sense out the responses in the respective business context. Our aim in always to create or extend the enterprise’s capabilities – its ‘ability to do work’, in many different senses – so as to enable an agile response to any changes in conditions, any new opportunities. And by monitoring everything as we go – such as with the SEMPER metric described later – we can amplify whatever works, and quietly dampen what doesn’t. 
But it is a different way of working with the enterprise, a different way of thinking, especially about the role of interventions and actions. It does take a while to get used to it, and to get others used to it, too. There are plenty of practical tools in this book, yet do note that most of them can only work well when combined with this different approach to enterprise effectiveness – please do bear that in mind as you read on! 
DIMENSIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS 
The dimensions of the enterprise 
In the previous chapter we briefly touched on the dimensions of effectiveness; at this point we need to look at them in more depth, to provide a firm foundation for the techniques that follow. 
The dimensions of effectiveness mentioned earlier – efficient, reliable, elegant, appropriate, integrated – are linked in turn what are, in effect, another related set of dimensions. In essence, these represent the categories of assets in the enterprise: physical, conceptual, relational and aspirational. 
Yes, I know: yet another bunch of abstract terms. But don’t worry about it: the names and details don’t matter that much, it’s the underlying notion of distinct dimensions that matters here. 
To illustrate this, imagine the enterprise as a participant in an old-fashioned street-market or bazaar. Within that market, we can see four discrete yet interwoven dimensions: 
there are transactions about physical products and services – the most visible and evident aspect of the activity in the marketplace; 
there’s an exchange of conceptual ideas and information – to quote the Cluetrain Manifesto, “markets are conversations”; 
the transactions and conversations help to create and maintain relational links between the market’s players – and without those interpersonal relationships, the market could not operate or exist; 
markets are about identity and purpose – the aspirations of individuals, and the shared purpose of the market as a whole. 
The market is all of these things, all blended together in a kind of bubbling brew of integration, distinctive in its own right, which we might call the ‘soul’ of the market. Hence, in turn, the ‘soul’ of an enterprise. 
Another way to understand these dimensions is in terms of the four classic ways to differentiate an enterprise from its peers and competitors: 
through products and services - physical / behavioural 
through knowledge and innovation - mental / conceptual 
through relationships and ‘feel’ - emotional / relational 
through vision and purpose - spiritual / aspirational 
‘Spiritual’ can seem a somewhat risky word in a business context – it tends to bring up the wrong kind of associations with religion and such. Yet though it’s obviously relevant to many non-profit organisations such as charities and pressure-groups, it’s actually essential for every enterprise. The core themes of the aspirational dimension – vision, values, identity, belonging, a sense of meaning and purpose – form the backbone to branding and much of marketing, to internal morale, to commitment and quality, and ultimately to the perceived social ‘licence to operate’. 
None of this can make any sense whilst we cling to the machine metaphor – after all, a machine has no soul (or no apparent soul, at any rate!). But it does make perfect sense once we think in terms of the ‘living enterprise’ – it’s the source of the organisation’s drive and creativity. An explicit description of such things becomes a core business asset, so we’ll see this often in successful large organisations: Hewlett-Packard’s ‘HP Way’ and Johnson & Johnson’s ‘Credo’ are two well-known examples. 
And there’s another angle on these same dimensions, through the lens of organisational culture: 
“the way we do things round here” – physical 
“what we know, how we think” – conceptual 
“how we relate with each other, and with others” – relational 
“who we are and what we stand for” – aspirational 
It’s crucial to understand here that these are dimensions, not layers – each is essential to the successful operation of the enterprise, and none of them has any inherent priority over any of the others. Because of this, perhaps the safest way to model the dimensions is as a tetradian, the four internal axes of a tetrahedron. Each axis or dimension is held stable by the other three; and by rotating our attention between them, every aspect of the enterprise can come into view. In effect, the tetradian describes the ‘innerstructure’ or internal skeleton of the enterprise. 
 

Tetradian model 
From this, it’s also clear that there are six link-themes that bridge between each pair of dimensions, providing the tension that holds this innerstructure together. We can loosely categorise the forms of these link-themes as follows: 
vision and values – linking spiritual / aspirational and   emotional / relational 
skills and leadership – linking emotional / relational and   physical / behavioural 
active learning – linking physical / behavioural and            mental / conceptual 
narrative and dialogue – linking mental / conceptual and emotional / relational 
sense-making and foresight – linking mental / conceptual and spiritual / aspirational 
responsibility and empowerment – linking spiritual / aspirational and physical / behavioural 
If any domain is poorly supported in any part of the organisation, the effectiveness of the overall enterprise is weakened; and if any link-theme is absent altogether, the entire structure will collapse – taking the enterprise down with it. And even if the specialist needs of each domain are adequately represented, the whole still won’t work well if there’s no generalist integration process to link every-thing together. Once this is understood, it becomes obvious that appropriate management of innerstructure is essential not just for enterprise effectiveness, but for sustainability and survival. 
However, don’t expect these domains – the dimensions and link-themes, and the process of integration that links them all together – to map directly to any specific department in an organisation. 
Some domains will be more visible in certain departments and business-functions: for example, the HR, sales and marketing departments will emphasise the relational dimension, production and warehousing emphasises the physical, whilst the strategy unit would be more concerned with sense-making and foresight, and perhaps with vision and values. Other domains are more evident at the boundaries between departments: who’s responsible for leadership development? for innovation and active learning? for the tacit knowledge embedded in narrative and dialogue? The reality is that the innerstructure underpins everything. Like infra-structure, only deeper, all the domains necessarily recur in every department and every business-function – and each domain needs appropriate action and support in every context. 
Effectiveness acronyms – REAL and LEARN 
Given this innerstructure, we can evaluate effectiveness in each domain through four keywords: 
Reliable - whether the activity can be relied upon to deliver the required results (maps to the physical dimension) 
Efficient - whether the activity makes the best use of available resources (maps to the conceptual dimension) 
Appropriate - whether the activity supports and sustains the overall purpose of the enterprise (maps to the aspirational dimension) 
Elegant - whether the activity supports the human factors in the context; also ‘elegance’ in the scientific sense, in that clarity and the like will support structural simplicity and re-use (maps to the relational dimension) 
The highlighted letters give us the acronym REAL for the direct dimensions of effectiveness. As we’ll see later when we look at the SEMPER metric, we can assess these both in their own right, and cross-mapped to the respective dimension of the innerstructure. 
It’s also advisable to assess how well each domain, and each activity within each domain, is integrated with the whole – how well it supports the other domains, and is supported by the other domains. This means that we also need to keep track of a kind of ‘meta-dimension’ that links the other dimensions together: 
Integrated - whether the activity is linked to and supports the integration of the whole 
If we add the highlighted letter to the previous set and give the result a minor tweak, we have the acronym LEARN as a keyword for the effective enterprise – the ‘learning organisation’. 
It can be relatively easy to assess efficiency and reliability in some domains, using the standard organisational toolkit of techniques built up over the past century. But in practice any overall assess-ment must inevitably be subjective, at least in part, because so much of the innerstructure is intangible. 
Even so, given a consistent methodology and clear guidelines, it’s possible to use REAL or LEARN to build a meaningful picture of effectiveness throughout the whole organisation – especially if assessments of different areas, at different times and by different people can be compared, contrasted and consolidated to provide a variety of perspectives on the whole. This is the basis of the SEMPER metric, which we’ll explore in detail later – see SEMPER (p.50). 
Effectiveness in complex systems 
The machine-metaphor works well in simple contexts and simple systems. It also works quite well as a way to understand a small sub-component of a large system, as long as the context can be reduced to something reasonably predictable and doesn’t have to deal with change. It’s convenient, yet it’s too simplistic: and as soon as we have to move outside of those artificial constraints, everything starts to fall apart. We find ourselves with intractable problems that keep coming back, sometimes in different forms, no matter how much we try to control them. So to deal with the real complexities of the real world, we need something that really does know about complexity. 
This is where systems-theory and complexity-science come into the picture – hence the ‘living enterprise’ metaphor, because it’s easiest to understand living organisms when we describe them in terms of complex systems. Unfortunately, most systems-theory is almost impenetrable at first for ordinary people in everyday busi-ness: it’s often too mathematical, too abstract to make immediate practical sense. Which, since we need it in order to understand how to enhance effectiveness, can be something of a problem. 
But there is one framework that arose in the business space – out of the knowledge-management domain, in fact – and which is easy (or easier) to apply in a business context. Known as Cynefin 
– apparently a Welsh word loosely translated as ‘place’ – it was originally developed by Dave Snowden and others at IBM, and was later spun-off to a separate company, Cognitive Edge.  It provides us with a visual summary of the different approaches we need to deal with different contexts in real-world complexity: 
 

Cynefin model of context complexity 
When we first start to look at a context, everything is in that central region of the ‘unknown’. We then have four distinct modes or domains for sense-making: recognise it as known; find some way to make it knowable in an ordered way; accept its inherent complexity; or accept it as an unique ‘market of one’. 
In the known domain everything is assumed to comply with simple, explicit, clearly-identifiable rules – the kind of ordered world that legislation and regulation would expect. There’s no need to stop and think: all we have to do here is sense the context, categorise, and respond in accordance with the respective rule. 
This is usually the preferred approach in a production environment, if only because there’s often no time to stop and think. The catch is that it’ll fall apart if it meets up with anything that can’t fit the rules. 
On one of our assignments we worked with a large security organisation which – true to type – was almost obsessive about strict compliance with rules. “But what happens if there’s an event that doesn’t fit the rules?”, we asked. 
“Easy – we make up another rule!” 
“Yes, but when do you make up the new rule?”  
“After the event, I suppose.” 
“So how do you handle the event itself, since you don’t have a rule for it at the time?” 
An interesting silence… 
In the knowable domain, an ordered world of cause-and-effect is still assumed, but it’s accepted that simple rules aren’t enough – it’s complicated. This is the preferred domain of the specialist, the analyst, the management consultant – the white-collar workers, the outsider ‘brain’ in the Taylorist machine-metaphor. The key tactic here is ‘sense, analyse, respond’, so there needs to be time to think – though we have to be careful to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’. 
At some point we hit ‘complication overload’, and move into the complex domain. Here we accept that no matter how much we’d like the world to conform to our predefined rules and analyses, reality is that much of the time it doesn’t. So the tactic here is ‘probe, sense, respond’, guided by skill, experience, heuristics, the occasional ‘rule of thumb’. Here we’d run multiple experiments in parallel, in a ‘safe-fail’ context, and pick out the most successful – most ‘elegant’ – solutions from their results. Although we look for a kind of truth here – and will often switch back and forth between this and the ‘knowable’ domain, to analyse our results – the emphasis is not on ‘the truth’ but ‘a truth’, a self-adapting pattern that we can re-use with agility in many different ways. 
A good example here is weather forecasting. For a long while it was hoped that we would be able to identify ‘the rules’, the science – however complicated – by which the weather really worked. Unfortunately, the realities of chaos-mathematics and the ‘butterfly effect’ put an end to that delightful deterministic dream … oh well… 
But we still have accurate weather forecasts – and they’re improving every year. What’s happened is that they still use the same massively complicated equations: but instead of looking for ‘the one true forecast’, forecasters run multiple, parallel computations, with small differences in their setup parameters, each leading to ‘a possibly-true forecast’. When several simulations converge on the same overall pattern, that’s the most probable weather outcome. It’s complex – but it works, where analysis alone did not. 
At the point of contact there’s always something that’s somewhat different, that doesn’t fit any rule at all: ultimately everything is in some way a unique ‘market of one’. This is the chaotic domain, and the key tactic here is one of ‘act, sense, respond’. In the knowable domain we have time for analysis, and in the complex domain we still have time to try out our experiments, but here, as in the known domain, we no longer have that luxury: we have to act now, and fast! But where the known domain assumes every-
thing is the same, and must be made to fit the rules, here we know that the rules won’t work, or at least won’t make sense: often here our principles and aspirations become the only reliable guide.  
As a guideline – though it’s not part of the Cynefin model as such – the domains do map approximately to the dimensions of effect-iveness as follows: 
known-domain (rules): physical dimension; reliable 
knowable-domain (analyses): conceptual dimension; efficient 
complex-domain (heuristics): relational dimension; elegant 
chaotic-domain (principles): aspirational dimension; appropriate 
In the real world of everyday business, effectiveness will depend greatly on choosing the appropriate Cynefin domain and the respective tactics to guide decision-making. For example, trying to apply rigid rules and regulations to a complex- or chaotic-domain context is never going to work well. Instead, we need to identify which parts of the context can be governed by rules, and which parts require heuristic- or principle-driven flexibility. 
Cynefin domains also indicate the required level of skill in each context. For a rule-bound context – in other words, the known-domain – routine training should usually suffice; but analytical skill would be needed in the knowable-domain, whilst extensive ex-perience is essential to work well in the complex-domain, and an even higher level of skill in the chaotic-domain. 
Another useful business-oriented source on systems thinking is the books by Peter Sengé and his colleagues on the concept and practice of the ‘learning organisation’ – The Fifth Discipline, The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook and The Dance of Change. Although the first book is perhaps a bit too heavy on theory for many people’s taste, the others are more like practical ‘cookbooks’, filled with concrete practical examples of the ‘learning organisation’ – a key attribute of enterprise effectiveness. 
Reviewing relevance 
The tetradian provides a view of the innerstructure of a given context, and the REAL and LEARN keywords provide a means to assess it. To enhance effectiveness, though, it’s also necessary to understand the relevance of each part in the overall context, and how issues in one context can be leveraged, balanced and traded 
off with other contexts in order to optimise the workings of the whole. 
This is where we put systems-theory into practice. The main techniques to do this are embodied in a set of principles adapted from complexity-science, denoted by the acronym R5: 
Rotation – look at the context from diverse perspectives 
Recursion – look for ways in which similar issues recur at different scales 
Reciprocation – look for balance or imbalance in transactions 
Resonance – look for the ‘snowball effect’ through which results tend to increase (positive-feedback) or decrease (damping) automatically over time 
Reflexion – look for ways in which the whole can be seen even in the smallest part 
The R5 principles are used both in assessment and in intervention design. 
Rotation is fairly straightforward: the aim is to gain a better under-standing of the context than would be available from a single perspective. However, this often involves dealing with contra-diction and conflict, as the views may well be different but are equally ‘true’ from their own perspective. The tetradian itself is an example of a rotation, providing different views of the organisation’s innerstructure from the perspective of each domain. Other examples include looking at the organisation from the viewpoint of each department, or from different operational levels, or from the perspectives of other stakeholders such as suppliers, customers, investors, government and the wider community. 
Recursion is helpful because it can highlight options to simplify processes and remove costly and ineffective ‘special cases’. It can also simplify training: recursion creates systems and structures that are much the same at many different levels and in different contexts, making it much easier to move people around as needed with only minimal context-specific training. The simplest business example of recursion is the reporting-hierarchy of the infamous ‘org-chart’: each person reports upward and has their own reports downward in the hierarchy-tree. A more sophisticated example is Stafford Beer’s Viable Systems Model, which was applied to the public service of an entire country – Allende’s Chile – and proved to be remarkably adaptable and resilient even under wartime con-ditions. Recursion is important in assessment, too, to review how 
issues affect one another at different scales, from the individual level, through work-group and business-unit, to the whole enterprise, the wider community and other interactions right up to the global scale. 
Reciprocation addresses two subtly different types of balance. At the tangible level, the standard models of classical physics apply: everything has to balance out. The catch, as general systems theory demonstrates, is that the balance - or re-balancing of any asymmetry - may be complex and difficult to decipher, often involving delays that span days or decades, or transformations from one type of energy to another. For most intangible assets, though, the balance is not a simple ‘win / lose’, but something closer to a choice between ‘win / win’ or ‘lose / lose’: either every-one wins, or everyone loses. Making sense of this type of symmetry depends on a radically different concept of power and responsibility, derived from the physics definition that ‘power is the ability to do work’, rather than the common social definitions which seem more to imply that power is the ability to avoid work. (For more detail on the power-model used in SEMPER, refer to the glossary entries for ‘power’ and ‘responsibility’, and the related terms such as ‘power-with’ and ‘power-against’ – see Appendix A: Glossary, p.133.) To assess this form of reciprocation, the focus is less on the surface appearances and appurtenances of ‘power’, or on who is purported to have it or not have it, but more on the type of work to be done, and the availability of the various types of energies and resources – physical, conceptual, relational, aspirational – which the work requires. 
Resonance is the exception to that reciprocal balance – the feedback loops which can be found in all complex real-world systems. In systems-theory this can occur through ‘positive feedback’ or feedforward – both of which increase the ‘snowball effect’ towards self-propagation – or as ‘negative feedback’, or damping, which reduces the effect. See Peter Sengé’s The Fifth Discipline for more on this, for example. 
Reflexion is more complex – literally so, as it’s one of the most important yet counter-intuitive concepts from complexity science. This is the holographic sense that every part, every place, every action in the enterprise somehow also contains within itself every other part of the enterprise. Identifying reflexion takes experience and an eye for detail, but it can save enormous amounts of time and effort in assessment and intervention design: as the eminent 
consultant Gerry Weinberg put it, “I always get the answer in the first five minutes – though it may take me hours or days or weeks to recognise what it was that I saw in those first five minutes!” One example is the way that the real values – not just the espoused values – of an enterprise and its culture are revealed in every conversation, every transaction, every workplace, every department, even though the surface similarities in each case may be small. 
Together, these elements – dimensions, domains, complexity and relevance – comprise an overall framework to enhance enterprise effectiveness. From here we can start to put it into practice. First, though, we need to simplify it one more step. We do so by re-structuring our key four elements to five – as described in the next chapter. 
 
 
FIVE ELEMENTS 
Time, workflow and process 
The tetradian in its standard tetrahedral form is a powerful tool for analysts and consultants, as we’ll see later, for example, with the full SEMPER diagnostic. We can rotate the tetradian in any direction, to give us different views on the whole enterprise. Yet at the concrete level of day-to-day business, it can at first seem too abstract for immediate use. To apply it at ‘the coalface’, we’ll often need to link it more closely to time, workflow and business process. 
One way to do this arises from the fact that the conceptual dimen-sion has two different emphases: looking forward to the near future – plans and preparations – and looking back at the past, at what has been done. This allows us to flatten out the tetradian into a single business-oriented cycle of five elements or 5Ps: Purpose, People, Preparation, Process, Performance. 
 

5Ps: the project cycle 
This is essentially the same as Bruce Tuckman’s ‘Group Dynamics’ sequence: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning. Proven in practice for more than fifty years, this well-known description of the project life-cycle can be found in any entry-level management text-book. The sequence explains not only the ‘natural’ steps of the life-cycle, but what happens in we try to miss out any of the steps – such as the chaos that ensues if we 
try to jump straight from idea to practice without dealing with the people-issues (‘Storming’) or a proper plan (‘Norming’). 
The difference here is that the 5Ps have the added dimensions of effectiveness and relevance – in effect, merging Group Dynamics with systems-theory. Where Group Dynamics describes a life-sequence for a single project, the 5Ps form a true cycle where the end of each project is also the start of another. And it’s recursive, reflexive, reciprocal and the rest: project-cycles contain and are contained within other project-cycles, all the way up to the enter-prise as a whole. 
Interestingly, this also maps exactly to another, much older framework: the classic Chinese ‘Five Elements’ of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water. The elements have complex relationships that can be supportive or destructive: for example, Wood feeds Fire, breaks up Earth, fractures Metal, dams Water. Of all the possible combinations of relationships, the sequence Wood . Fire . Earth . Metal . Water is the only one in which each element naturally supports the next – and it’s an exact metaphor of the sequence in Group Dynamics. 
As consultants, that mapping has provided us with many valuable insights into what would otherwise have been intractable business issues. For an example, see the section later about Five Elements in business analysis (p.32). 
We can summarise the 5Ps from a business perspective as follows: 
Purpose (‘Forming’; ‘Wood’) 
Role perspective: “why?” – vision, values, purpose, identity; core principles for decision-making 
Time focus: mid- to far-future 
Business-context examples: policy & strategy, R&D, product development 
People (‘Storming’; Fire’) 
Role perspective: “who?” – roles, skills, experience, quality of internal relationships and trust 
Time focus: mixed (past . future) 
Business-context examples: HR, marketing 
Preparation (‘Norming’; ‘Earth’) 
Role perspective: “which to do? what to do? when to do? where to do? how to do?” – knowledge, planning, mindsets, beliefs 
Time focus: near future 
Business-context examples: planning, scheduling and logistics, purchasing, supplies 
Process (‘Performing’; ‘Metal’) 
Role perspective: “is!” (no time for questions!) – resources, actions, environments 
Time focus: immediate – “now!”  
Business-context examples: production, sales 
Performance (‘Adjourning’; ‘Water’) 
Role perspective: “which was done? what was done? when was it done? where was it done? how was it done?” - bringing it all together, completions, lessons-learned, ‘calling to account’ 
Time focus: past 
Business-context examples: accounts, quality assurance, despatch 
Although the mapping is not as exact as with Group Dynamics or the Chinese five elements, there’s another useful cross-reference to the Total Quality Management (TQM) cycle Plan . Do .  Check . Act. TQM’s ‘Plan’ phase is much the same as 5Ps ‘Preparation’, and ‘Do’ is obviously similar to ‘Process’. TQM’s ‘Check’ straddles across both ‘Performance’ and the transition to the new cycle at ‘Purpose’, whilst the mapping for TQM’s ‘Act’ is rather more blurred, from ‘Purpose’ to aspects of ‘People’, and even to ‘Preparation’ again at the strategic rather than tactical level. Because 5Ps is linked so strongly to systems-theory, this gives us a means to link existing quality-management efforts to a more recursive and reflexive view of the enterprise as a whole – a valuable tool in enterprise architecture. 
But where the 5Ps model really scores is that it provides a means to understand and resolve internal conflict within the enterprise. It does so by showing how the perspective on time will change during the project life-cycle which impacts not only on workflow and process, but on what should otherwise be supportive relationships between the different departments that are responsible for the different phases of the overall workflow. To understand those conflicts – and what to do to resolve them – we need to develop an experiential understanding of those five perspectives. 
Five perspectives – an exercise on conflict 
One of the most visible factors impacting on enterprise effective-ness is interpersonal conflicts – especially all those arguments, or feuds even, that rage between the different departments of the enterprise. Reducing those conflicts would make everyone’s life a lot easier, and go a long way towards getting a lot more done… 
The key insight here is that although some conflict does arise from personality-clashes, much if not most arises from differences in role-perspectives and role-timeframes – it’s not that others are being ‘awkward’ or whatever, but that the differences arise from the natural flow of work through the project lifecycle. The conflicts are inevitable, inherent in the work itself, so there’s no way we can prevent them as such; but what we can do is take the heat of them. 
So here’s an exercise using the 5Ps – purpose, people, preparation, pocess and performance – as a framework to assess and resolve role-based conflict. The overall aim is to show – and experience – how to improve overall effectiveness of the enterprise by accepting and working with the natural conflicts and natural flows in work. For the workshop itself, you’ll need the usual whiteboard and a meeting-space that permits clustering of participants into five groups. 
Part 1: Effectiveness and conflict 
Our objectives in this part are to identify criteria for personal, group and collective success, and to identify differences between individual and group definitions of success. 
The key concepts we introduce here are the notion of effectiveness as ‘efficient and on purpose’; and the layering of definitions of ‘success’ – personal, group (department), collective (organisation) and so on. 
Step 1: Introduce self and participants 
This should be the usual quick thirty-seconds-per-person intro-duction of participants – who they are, their backgrounds, roles, expectations and the like. 
Step 2: Situation, complication, question, answer 
Introduce the topics for the workshop, using the classic frame of ‘situation, complication, question, answer’. Allow perhaps fifteen minutes overall for this. 
The situation: every organisation wants to be effective – to achieve and sustain high performance – in whatever way performance may be measured. 
How would you know when you’re effective, when you’ve succeeded? How do you define success? (layers of success: organisational, departmental, personal) 
Elicit opinions, anecdotes and experiences on this; cluster some of these on the whiteboard. 
Hint towards links between definition of success (Purpose) and measurement of success (Performance). 
The complication: to a greater or lesser extent, the effectiveness of the enterprise is constrained and limited by fragmentation and by interpersonal and inter-departmental conflicts. 
What are some of these constraints and conflicts? 
As before, elicit opinions, anecdotes and experiences on this, clustering as appropriate on the whiteboard 
The question: Is this happening just because people are awkward? Are they deliberately sabotaging success? Or what? 
Once more, elicit opinions, anecdotes and experiences on this, creating clusters on the whiteboard. 
Summarise, then lead to: 
An answer: No, it’s mostly because they each look at the world from different perspectives and with different time-frames – and don’t realise that the view isn’t the same for everyone else. Most of the conflicts are natural, arising from the nature of the work itself. 
Part 2: The structure of conflict 
The objective for this part is to distinguish between direct inter-personal conflict, and contextual conflict that arises from roles and timeframes. 
This is where we introduce the key concepts for the exercise itself: that although some conflict arises from personality-clashes (which we’re not dealing with here), most conflict in organisations arises 
from role-perspectives and role-timeframes; and that we can use the 5Ps framework to assess and resolve this role-based conflict. 
Step 1: The structure of organisations 
Allow about ten minutes overall for this step. A typical introductory script would be as follows: 
We’d like to show you a simple framework and set of techniques to address the conflicts that arise from different perspectives. These will: 
give you a direct experience of integration, of working within a whole 
give you a better grasp of where your and others’ work fits within the whole 
help to reduce conflicts 
improve overall effectiveness. 
 

Business labels for Five Elements 
Describe the structure and functions of your enterprise in terms of these five categories: 
Purpose: beginnings, ideas, future 
People: energy, expression, the ‘interpersonal stuff’ 
Preparation: settling down, getting ready, getting everything in its place 
Process: doing it, often with lots of noise! 
Performance: completions, wrapping up, tidying up all the loose ends 
Elicit descriptions of these labels as departments or business-units within the organisation, so that they can claim the 5Ps labels as something of their own. Write these descriptions against the label-names on the whiteboard. 
Create business-oriented 5P labels for each table or table-cluster. 
Place the label on the respective table or cluster as each label is described. 
Step 2: Same and different at every level 
In this brief five-minute step we would introduce the scaling issue of recursion: each of these domains – as per the labels from the previous step – also includes all of the other 5Ps domains within itself. For example, a production environment would – or should – also include within itself its own purpose, people, preparation and performance sub-domains, and so on, almost ad infinitum. 
Step 3: One view of the world 
Here we start to build not just the idea but the feeling of contextual view. To do this, we get each group to describe their view of themselves and others, in terms of the work-context. 
We don’t want to pre-empt the shift of feeling that happens in the next step, so warn people that if they’re sitting at a table or cluster that’s labelled with their usual work-role, this would be a good time to move somewhere else! 
Going round the clusters, ask participants to describe: 
the priorities, concerns and constraints from within ‘their’ cluster 
their view of each of the other clusters – being as happily rude as they like! 
Laughter is important here. It should be safe to use – in fact encourage – pejorative terms, because no-one’s sitting in their ‘usual’ role, but do be careful to dissuade any direct personal attacks and to use laughter to diffuse any tension. Emphasise the stereotype-labels for each grouping of ‘others’ – ‘the people-people’, ‘the bean-counters’ and so on – to reduce the risk of attacks on individuals. 
Elicit comments about relative time-frames, but don’t make this explicit as yet. 
Put selected statements up on the whiteboard, showing the vectors to each cluster. 
At the end, the summary from the whiteboard should show that: 
everyone has a clear view of their own work – of what the enterprise needs, from the perspective of that 5Ps label 
from each perspective, everyone is certain that they are right 
everyone else is wrong! 
Step 4: All move round one 
Having been happily rude to everyone else, it’s now time to explore how it feels to be on the receiving-end. 
Before we do this, we need everyone to move around to a different space, either literally or metaphorically. Either move the participants round one to the next table, or allow them to move at random, but in any case to a different cluster; or else move the labels round one. (The latter usually doesn’t work so well – if only because getting people to move around also usefully lifts the group-energy – but practical constraints such as seating in a lecture theatre may make it necessary in some environments.) 
Read back the incoming views of each cluster – those ‘happily rude’ descriptions from the previous step. Ask how it feels to be described by others in that way.  
We’re looking for pHRases like “they’re being unfair”, or “they don’t understand what we do”. Emphasise these as they come up, particularly where the same feeling is expressed by different groups. 
Summarise as follows: 
the sense of feeling misunderstood and the like by others is universal. 
the ‘unfairness’ comes not from those other people as such, but from the natural view from that the role – especially when the perspective is thought of as ‘the only right view’ 
This shows us that many of the conflicts we deal with at work are the natural result of different perspectives: 
a ‘de Bono-ism’: “everyone is always right [from their own perspective] but no-one’s ever right” [ because no one perspective can see the whole] 
When we remember to look at ‘the world’ from other perspectives, we immediately reduce the tension in the conflicts – and immed-iately increase the overall effectiveness. 
Part 3: Conflicting timeframes 
The objectives in this part are to become aware of differences in timeframes, and to distinguish between the local validity of each timeframes versus the dangers of the universal application of a single timeframe. 
The key concepts we introduce here are that each role-perspective also has its own specific timeframe, and that conflicts can arise from unrecognised differences in timeframes. 
Step 1: Timeframes 
What we’ll explore here is that the clashes arise not just from different perspectives, but also different timeframes. 
Allow ten minutes or so to go round each cluster, eliciting descrip-tions and comments. 
Place summaries from each cluster on the respective section of the whiteboard. The aim should be to end up with something like the following list: 
Purpose: mid- to far-future 
People: random, ‘all over the place’ 
Preparation: near future 
Process: “now!” 
Performance: past 
Referencing these descriptions, go round each cluster again, asking what would happen if they try to do the respective activity from the wrong timeframe. 
Essentially what we’re after is a sense that if we do this, there’d be total chaos and ineffectiveness. 
Indicate that this is what happens when one perspective dominates – when there’s only ‘one right view’ in the enterprise. 
Step 2: Only one view 
Go round each cluster, eliciting comments from the whole group about what would happen (or does happen) if one perspective were to dominate the enterprise. Allow ten minutes or so to do this. Take care to ensure that comments are aimed to the role, and to deflect comments away from the participants currently sitting ‘in’ that role. For example, stand at each place, and encourage comments to be aimed at self rather than at the cluster. 
What we’re after are examples such as the following (in element order): 
Purpose: “dreamers and ‘idea-hamsters’ run the place”: nothing gets started, let alone finished. 
People: “people-issues run the place”: a lot of activity but nothing much actually happens; instead, there are endless discussions about who might do what, or who might get what – or, worse, the place is dominated by interpersonal politics and jockeying for position. 
Preparation: “planners run the place”: the place gets stuck in ‘analysis paralysis’. 
Process: “production managers run the place”: everything is now!, urgent, no forward or (often) even backward view. 
Performance: “accountants run the place”: everything is focussed on performance indicators and the backward view. 
Notice also that the dominant element tends to be different for different types of enterprise: 
Purpose: academics and think-tanks 
People, Preparation: government organisations and non-profits 
Process, Performance: commercial organisations 
Separate into small groups (not necessarily on cluster boundaries) to identify which elements dominate in their own enterprise, how this affects their own work and their personal commitment to the work, and how they do or can resolve the clashes. Allow perhaps fifteen minutes for this discussion  
Either during or at the end of the discussion-period, invite participants to provide  summaries, comments and suggestions to put up on the whiteboard. Cluster the comments around each of the five elements on the board such that there is a visible gap remaining in the centre. 
The aim here is that the participants should themselves notice the gap – for example, at one of our workshops, a senior executive suddenly blurted out, “Hang on, who’s in the centre?” If this doesn’t happen, allude to it during the wrap-up for this step. 
Summarise by showing that a single view tends to dominate when the work of the enterprise itself tends to emphasise that view – giving the illusion that that one view is ‘the right one’, or at least should always have the final say. This also occurs where there is poor communication between perspectives, as in the classic ‘silos’ scenario. 
But if – as the participants themselves have just demonstrated – real problems arise if one view is allowed to dominate, this leads naturally to an important question: 
Step 3: Who’s minding the store? 
Who’s holding the centre? Who is responsible for ensuring that the baton is passed cleanly between each of the perspectives, in a mutually-supportive workflow? Who’s responsible for ensuring that one perspective doesn’t ride roughshod over all the others? Who’s 
responsible for resolving the perspective-conflicts that we’ve explored in the workshop? 
The short answer, in far too many organisations, is no-one – which is precisely why there’s a problem… There’s an essential role here for a generalist, a communicator, someone who has enough grasp of all of the perspectives so as to be able to translate between them. Or several roles, rather, since the same need will recur all the way from the top – where ideally, if rarely, the CEO is exactly this kind of generalist – right down to the ‘coal-face’. 
The catch is that, especially at the more delivery-oriented levels, personal performance is usually measured in specialist terms – in terms of one perspective. So the more these generalists do their ‘communicator’ role, the less they appear to do, from the point of view of that single perspective – “they do nothing but talk all day! distracting us from real work! we don’t have time for this stuff!” – and hence may well be penalised for improving the effectiveness of the overall enterprise. To do their ‘real work’, generalists will often need protection and support all the way from the top – and their performance measured in terms of the whole, rather than any one part. 
Split the participants into small discussion groups to explore these issues: 
who are the generalists and ‘translators’ in the enterprise? 
what official labels – if any – are assigned to their ‘communicator’ or ‘translator’ roles? to whom do they report, and how and why? 
what support – if any – do they have in those roles? is the support covert, or officially sanctioned – a typical tacit “do what you can and we’ll cover up for you”, or a formally authorised role with its own performance-metrics? what can be done to move the support from the former to the latter? 
what else could be done in the enterprise to support this need to ‘hold the centre’? 
As before, allow perhaps fifteen minutes for this discussion. 
Add to the whiteboard the summaries, comments and suggestions from the groups, showing also how some roles and activities act as ‘ambassadors’ between specific perspectives and the centre, or between perspectives. 
To wrap up, show that what’s been built up on the whiteboard is a summary of the whole ‘living enterprise’, with a clear sense of its 
future, acting in the now, and aware of its past – and accepting people as people, too. If there are imbalances visible there – which is usually the case – it now should be clear what needs to be done to resolve them. 
Part 4: Working with conflict 
This section isn’t part of the workshop as such, but is a practical way to show how to work with this natural conflict rather than trying to suppress it. 
The objectives here are to show other practical applications for the Five Elements (5Ps) framework, and to develop the ability to switch between perspectives and timeframes as appropriate. 
The key concepts we emphasise here are that there is a natural flow between the 5Ps, and that the ‘communicators’ in the enter-prise need to be able to work with and translate between each of the perspectives and timeframes. 
Steps: Working with the conflict 
We’ve seen that many of the conflicts in organisations arise as a natural consequence of the perspectives and timeframes. We’ve also seen the problems that arise if any one perspective tends to dominate, or if the roles in the transitions between elements are missed. 
 

Direct supportive flow around the elements 
So what follows is a way to use the Five Elements to keep track of the whole. It’s especially useful as a meeting-management framework – somewhat like de Bono’s ‘Six Hats’ – but it also works well as a quick summary and checklist in any context. 
Go through each of the elements in sequence. In a meeting, the whole group works with one element at a time (much like ‘Six 
Hats’). Within your group, select a current business-issue, and assess it in terms of these elements: 
Purpose: What’s the purpose here? What are we aiming to do? What is the perspective in the timeframe of mid- to far-future? (Use the question of identity – Who is ‘We’ here? – to move towards People.) 
People: Who do we have? What are their skills and experience, interests, concerns, availability? What alliances do we need? What are the interpersonal issues? What changes in perspective occur as the timeframe swings around here, from far-past to far-future and back again? (Return to skills and availability, and integrate with the Purpose-issues, to move towards Preparation.) 
Preparation: What’s the plan? What resources, skills, experience, alliances do we have available? What’s the perspective from the time-frame of the near-future? (Return to the plan, and integrate with the Purpose-issues and People-issues, to move towards Process.) 
Process: What are we doing – right now? How does what we do in each moment affect the other timeframes of future and past? How do we minimise distractions from other timeframes, other perspectives? (Focus on how to keep track of what’s happening, of what’s been done and not done, as work progresses, to integrate with the previous issues of Purpose, People and Preparation, and move towards Performance.) 
Performance: What have we done? How do we measure success, in terms of each of the elements? What lessons can we learn from what’s been done? (Use the focus on ‘lessons learned’ to integrate back with Purpose, People, Preparation and Process, and move on to a new cycle at Purpose.) 
Some other questions to consider: 
What are the elements (or 5Ps) here? What capabilities and needs do we have in each domain? Who is responsible for each domain? 
What are the flows, in time and space, between each domain? 
How do we manage the inherent differences of perspective between the domains? 
What support do we provide for leading transitions between elements? 
What support do we provide for ‘holding the centre’? Who is responsible for ‘holding the centre’? 
Ask for comments, suggestions and insights. Place these up on the whiteboard in five-element format. 
On completion, work with the group to derive decisions as appropriate from the summaries on the whiteboard. 
Wrap up the meeting with a ‘lessons learned’ section – in other words the Performance phase, or Group Dynamics’ ‘Adjourning’ – to summarise not only the outcome of the meeting, but also any insights from the process itself. 
(See the Real Enterprise Architecture book for examples of how to use the same principles on a much larger scale, at the level of the whole enterprise.) 
Five Elements in business analysis 
Another use for Five Elements is in workflow analysis. Every path through a business-process is also a kind of mini-project in its own right, with its own 5Ps sequence of Purpose, People, Preparation, Process and Performance. If we move the view upward, it then becomes possible to see the entire enterprise as a web of inter-connected services – the ‘service-oriented enterprise’. Different workgroups provide each other with the respective 5Ps services. 
What happens, though, when the enterprise focus is on one of the 5Ps, and it tries to merge with a group that has a different focus? That’s what occurred with a client of ours – leading to a simmering conflict that at first seemed bizarre and inexplicable. But when we used a Five Elements approach to describe the situation, it not only became immediately obvious what was going on, but also what to do to make the merger work. 
The enterprise was a large government research facility with an enviable international reputation in its field. The government of the day was doing one of its periodic purges, shedding full-time employees and pushing the work out to commercial service-providers. Although the facility itself wasn’t much affected by this, there was a risk of losing essential experience from the field – so a few key groups of field-engineers were ‘protected’ from privatisation by moving them under the aegis of the laboratory. 
It had seemed a good idea at the time, such an obvious solution to the problem: “they’re all technical types, they’ll get on like a house 
on fire!”, one of the senior executives had said to us. But the argu-ments started within days, and grew more and more acrimonious as the weeks went by… 
Yes, true, they were all ‘technical types’: but no-one had thought about the subtle differences – especially time-perspectives. “We get a job out in three days”, snapped one of the engineers; “that lot over there can barely get a report out in three years!” From their side, the scientists complained that the engineers were inflexible, sticking rigidly to the rule-book even when it didn’t make sense, and tending to act first and think later - “if at all”, muttered one disgruntled researcher. It was not a happy time… 
Once we applied a Five Elements approach, though, it was clear straight away what was happening. By their nature, scientists are all about Purpose, the future, the uncertainty of new ideas and new beginnings. And the engineers, by their nature, are all about certainty, hard fact, concrete action, the immediacy of ‘Now!’. In the classic Chinese terms, one is Wood, the other is Metal: not a good combination, to say the least. 
 

Research-establishment merger: elements out of balance 
Even worse, there’s an inherent asymmetry in the relationship: Wood eventually fractures Metal, but Metal quickly chops down Wood. By the very nature of their work and time-perspective, the engineers would have a disproportionate impact on the entire establishment. Yet no-one would acknowledge that there was a problem: which meant that – again in Chinese terms – the Fire of interpersonal conflicts went further and further out of control. 
The solution was not to try to stop the conflict as such, but to ‘fill in the gaps’ – in other words, emphasise the rest of the Five Elements, in their ‘supportive flow’ sequence: 
 

Research-establishment merger: elements in balance 
For the Fire or ‘People’ element, we set up a formal procedure (the engineers liked formal procedures!) for conflict-resolution between the two groups. This was nothing special: a couple of written procedures to outline roles and responsibilities; a regular meeting to review the overall work-relationship between the two groups; and an escalation process to handle day-to-day issues. The key point here was to acknowledge that the conflicts were a natural and necessary consequence of the work: the scientists needed flexibility, the engineers needed structure, so there would always be conflicts there. So no-one was ‘wrong’ for being in conflict with others in that sense, it was just something to be respected and addressed as a routine aspect of the work. Simple, yet it worked really well: it took the heat out of the overall conflict in a matter of days. 
Next, for Earth, or the ‘Preparation’ element, we adapted the engineers’ scheduling system to a shared tool for communication between the two groups. Again, we could implement this at very low cost: we converted their existing spreadsheet to a database, and added an off-the-shelf intranet front-end with a wiki-type hook-up that allowed both groups to add and exchange comments about project-schedules. This also made it possible for researchers to slot small experiments into the engineers’ workload in a predictable way, without disrupting their routine work – removing what had previously been a major source of contention. 
The final missing element was Water, or ‘Performance’ – in this case, the ‘lessons-learned’ records via which the engineers’ work could support that of the researchers. This was more difficult, because all work-results had to be recorded and stored in a structured way which emphasised not just the final report – all that was required by the engineers’ usual end-clients – but also inputs 
and outputs of all the intermediate process-steps – which was what the researchers needed, to feed into their own analyses. But here we were able to leverage off some previous work for a workflow  /  database system for another major project elsewhere in the laboratory, which defined all the data-structures and workflow meta-structures that we needed. The structured framework also made it easier to develop process-documentation for formal accreditation of the engineers’ quality-system. 
With this support for the missing elements in place, relationships between the two groups shifted from mutual conflict to mutual support – a happy outcome all round, and one that definitely enhanced the overall effectiveness of the enterprise. 
SCORE FOR STRATEGY 
SCORE for strategic assessment 
Strategy is where the enterprise identifies its first moves towards a desired future. This isn’t solely an issue for a separate ‘strategy team’ for senior executives: as we’ve seen, the ‘brain of the firm’ is distributed throughout the enterprise. So to enhance effectiveness, the tetradian’s Aspirational dimension (or the Five Elements’ ‘Purpose’ domain) needs appropriate support in every activity, at every level. Strategy occurs everywhere. 
The classic checklist for quick strategic assessments is SWOT: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, THReats. (If you’re not familiar with this, you can look it up in almost any management textbook.) It’s a useful tool, but it does have some real limitations, especially around the impact of strategy on overall effectiveness. Rethinking SWOT as SCORE gives us a versatile alternative with a stronger emphasis on effectiveness, and gives us a chance to test out in practice some of the principles we’ve seen so far. 
So it’s useful to explore in brief the constraints of SWOT, and how SCORE resolves those limitations. Here we’ll look at how to use SCORE in practice, and end with a real-world SCORE example, about data-architecture strategy in the utilities industry. 
Like SWOT, SCORE is an acronym for a strategy checklist: 
Strengths 
Challenges 
Options 
Responses 
Effectiveness 
We focus in turn on our Strengths; our Challenges; our Options and opportunities; the probable Responses and returns of the strategy; and the impact on overall Effectiveness. 
Another difference is that we’re also looking for anything we can measure, either qualitative or quantitative – hence “What’s the SCORE?”. And we do the same assessment before and after we apply the strategy – which tells us whether or not the strategy actually worked. 
Critique of SWOT 
Why rethink SWOT? After all, it’s been around for decades, and it’s easy to understand and use. It has the same kind of two-axis matrix beloved by consultants everywhere – in this case, assets versus concerns, and ‘internal’ versus ‘external’ relative to the enterprise. And its methodology is about as simple as it gets: tick the boxes, and you’re just about done. “Strengths? Weaknesses? Opportunities? THReats? Everything look okay? Right, let’s do it!” 
 

SWOT – a classic two-axis matrix 
SWOT is great for a quick check. But its subtle yet serious limit-ations do create real problems in developing strategy, and in devolving that strategy into tactics. 
One is that some of its language can be pejorative and misleading, and introduces a spurious sense of danger – literally, of weakness, or of tHReat. ‘Weakness’ also implies inadequacy, ‘not good enough’ and so on – which can be awkward when we’re assessing people-issues. 
It also creates an arbitrary boundary between ‘inside’ and ‘out-side’. This isn’t helpful when the boundary between ‘us and them’ is blurred – as it must be, for example, in value-webs or end-to-end networks where our customers may also be our suppliers, or in consortia where our nominal competitors are also our partners. 
And SWOT doesn’t really have the breadth of scope to cope with whole-of-system context, or continuity over time. Issues tend to be viewed in isolation, as strategy for this single issue, ignoring its broader background. The process tends to be used ‘once-off’, then forgotten: in some cases it may be repeated, but there’s no explicit requirement to create links between repetitions. 
So to make SWOT more useful in today’s more complex world, we need to make the language more real – not ‘weaknesses’ or ‘tHReats’. We need to adapt it for use in broader, more complex contexts, in which boundaries between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ may be blurred by multi-organisation partnerships and value-webs. We also need to adapt it for a more holistic view, how each asset or concern interacts with others – in other words, assess impact on overall effectiveness. And we need to enhance the methodology, using iterative reviews with qualitative  /  quantitative scores, and ‘before and after’ comparison of reviews and scores. 
The revision as SCORE addresses all of these concerns. 
SCORE process  
SCORE addresses those requirements with a SWOT-like checklist as a framework for strategy: 
Strengths  /  services  /  support: what we already have – existing capabilities and resources, potential for synergies 
Challenges  /  capabilities needed: what we know we need, or need to address – ‘weaknesses’ indicate needed capabilities and resources 
Options  /  opportunities and risks: look at the outside world for options and opportunities – opportunity is also risk, risk is also opportunity 
Responses  /  returns  /  rewards: probable responses of the outside world to the chosen strategy – probable or emergent consequences of action or inaction 
Effectiveness: probable impacts of the strategy on overall effectiveness – efficient, reliable, elegant, appropriate, integrated 
Where this differs from SWOT is that we do this iteratively and recursively, comparing each dimension against the others; and we look for and record anything that can be measured, so we can assess the success of the strategy in future. 
The questions for the Strengths dimension are much the same as for SWOT, except that we need to look both inside and outside our own organisation for shared strengths and support: 
Strengths: What would we regard as our strengths in this? 
Services: What services and capabilities do we have? What services can we call on from others? 
Support: What support-resources do we have available to us? What support do we have, from others? 
The work of projects is carried out through services and capabilities, so these questions also help to identify the existing components of a ‘service-oriented architecture’ for the enterprise. 
The subsidiary questions about support are essential. Without explicit support from senior management, the project can only be run as a concealed ‘skunk-works’ project – which would mean a lot more work overall, for everyone. 
From here we gain both an inventory of strengths and services, and a list of probable partners in the project – in other words, what we have available to respond to opportunities, and to support the change-roadmap. 
The questions for the Challenges dimension are again similar to SWOT. But we avoid SWOT’s pejorative term ‘weakness’ here, instead concentrating much more on gap-analysis – on identifying what would be needed in order to achieve the key success criteria for the project: 
Challenges: What are the issues we need to address, within the organisation, and in relationships with partners, suppliers, other stakeholders? 
Capabilities needed: What new capabilities and services would we need? What skills would be required? What would be needed to develop these skills and services? 
The end-result of this direction of questioning is a list of internal project-risks, and also of needed capabilities – and hence core content for a roadmap for change. 
Opportunities give rise to Options, which in turn provide the formal basis for a ‘roadmap’ for change: 
Opportunities: What opportunities present themselves? What risks arise from with those opportunities? What opportunities arise from apparent risks? 
Options: What are our options in relation to those opportunities and risks? How can we act on those options? How should we prioritise those options and actions? 
As with SWOT, we should be looking mostly outward here, at the ‘outside’ world – potential customers, partners, providers and the like. 
But unlike SWOT, we always assess opportunities and risks together, because each is the flipside of the other: opportunities bring concomitant risks, and risks (SWOT’s ‘tHReats’) also always present opportunities. 
What we’re looking at here – and looking for – are the drivers for business change: the opportunities and risks, and our options to respond to each. This identifies the reasons for the changes that we need to make, the priorities for the change-roadmap, and external project-risks arising directly from those opportunities. 
Where ‘Opportunities’ is about how we look at the outside world, the Responses questions are more about how the outside world impinges on us: 
Responses: What responses would we expect from other stakeholders? from customers? competitors? providers? partners? 
Regulations: What regulations might arise in response to our strategy? What would be the impacts of new or upcoming legislation? 
Returns  /  rewards: What is the business value of each opportunity and risk? 
Even a brief focus on regulation and legislation also helps to expand our awareness of longer-term impacts – legislation may move at a much slower pace than business cycles, for example, but its impacts cannot be avoided forever! 
At least some of these expected responses should be measurable, identifying the overall returns or rewards – in other words, the business case (if any) for the strategy, and the external risks impinging indirectly on the opportunities. 
The Effectiveness questions are the key difference from conven-tional SWOT analysis: 
Efficient: Does it optimise use of resources, minimise wastage of resources? 
Reliable: Is it predictable, consistent, self-correcting? 
Elegant: Does it have clarity, simplicity, consistency? Is it self-adjusting for human factors? 
Appropriate: Does it support and maximise support for business purpose? 
Integrated: Does it create, support and maximise synergy across all systems? 
This identifies how well the ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ systems fit in with everything else. The aim here is to resolve a classic business dilemma: how to ensure that improvements in efficiency in one area do not cause greater inefficiencies elsewhere – a common result of traditional analysis techniques. 
Working with the above questions, the steps of the SCORE methodology are as follows: 
1. Select an issue 

2. Start the SCORE checklist anywhere, on any dimension (often start with Strengths, or Options, but it’s not required) 

3. Work through all dimensions in the list (repeat and iterate in any order) 

4. Assess impact of each item on effectiveness 

5. Identify and record any measurable items such as new capabilities, and compare against previous SCORE assessments 


 

Visual representation of the SCORE methodology 
Once we select an issue to assess, we can start from any dimen-sion. We then work through all of the SCORE dimensions, using the viewpoint of each dimension as a perspective on each of the other dimensions. 
And for everything that we identify, we always look at its impact on overall effectiveness, using the effectiveness-checklist: efficient, reliable, elegant, appropriate, integrated. 
We also keep an eye open for anything that can be measured, whether as a numeric value or qualitatively – for example, a new capability that didn’t exist at the time of a previous SCORE assessment. The reason for this is simple: it’s a lot easier to manage things that can be measured. 
At the end of the SCORE assessment, these are the kinds of documents we would expect to have to hand, to guide subsequent change: 
‘Strengths’ dimension: capabilities  /  services inventory, support  /  partner-map 
‘Challenges’ dimension: prioritised requirements and roadmap for change, risks  /  issues register 
‘Options’ dimension: strategy scenarios, opportunity  /  risk trade-off register 
‘Responses’ dimension: business case(s), risk-management scenarios 
‘Effectiveness’ dimension: project impact  /  integration assessments 
To summarise, SCORE extends SWOT analysis with a new emphasis on overall effectiveness.. Where SWOT is a single pass through the checklist, SCORE is iterative: we repeat the process as required, to address all issues and side-themes. At the end of the process, the documents produced should provide us with a clear roadmap for business change.  
SCORE in practice – a real-world example  
This real example of SCORE analysis was on data-architecture strategy for a major utilities company. I’ve used a fictitious name for the company (‘Energy’), and changed a few other identifying details, but otherwise the information here is the same as in the slides prepared for the company’s enterprise-architecture group. 
As you’ll see, the main difference from SWOT is that the end-result is not just a go / no-go decision, but a detailed roadmap of the required changes. 
Strengths... 
These were Energy’s existing strengths in data-architecture: 
Business support for enterprise architecture 
higher-than-usual awareness of value of architecture 
evidence of high-level commitment 
integrated view of the business 
Higher-level maturity of conceptual frames 
awareness that enterprise architecture is more than IT 
Some essential work already done 
Architecture Principles, Blueprint, BIM, Evolution SOA 
Commitment and energy! 
Challenges... 
These were the challenges that needed to be addressed: 
Support exists, but still under-resourced 
No adequate commercial toolsets available for business-information 
most tools are for logical . physical mapping only – e.g. ERwin, Visio UML 
System Architect probably the best of breed, but still has severe limitations – e.g. fragility of Choices list, ‘user-hostile’ interface etc 
Need to break free of IT-centric view 
 ‘business’ is too easily viewed as ‘anything not-IT’ 
Opportunities  /  risks  /  trade-offs... 
These were the opportunities, risks and trade-offs – where data-architecture fitted within the broader picture of company strategy: 
Opportunity for improved communication 
synergies where business and IT are ‘on the same page’ 
Risks of market  /  regulatory change 
data-architecture supports agility to external change 
Trade-off between modelling everything versus getting things done 
improved self-knowledge and reduced long-term costs, versus project delays and loss of business credibility 
“doing it at all takes priority over doing it right...” 
complexity of modelling a dynamic world 
the world is not static, there is no final ‘future state’ 
Returns  /  rewards... 
This was a brief summary of the kind of returns and responses from implementing (or not implementing) a disciplined data archi-tecture: 
Leverage available from synergies 
across systems 
across products and product-lines 
across organisational units and groups 
across ‘value-webs’ with partners, suppliers etc 
Agility from Energy’s increased ‘self-knowledge’ 
improved ability to service new markets 
improved ability to respond to regulatory change 
improved ability to manoeuvre in competitive market 
Also need for increased business  /  technical awareness of costs of not doing this well... 
...and effectiveness 
And an overview of the impact on overall effectiveness of the current state of data-architecture in the company: 
Efficient? 
fragmented legacy systems, too much exception-handling 
Reliable? 
fragile data-flows, especially round-trip overwrites 
inconsistent naming etc creates misunderstanding  /  rework 
Elegant? 
market-specific models, high dependence on human processes 
Appropriate? 
poor integration of legacy systems limits business agility 
inadequate support for e.g. customer-centric view of data 
Integrated? 
lack of integration identified as a key business issue 
Evolution Initiative role is to improve overall integration 
Where are the gaps? 
The previous questions pointed either directly or indirectly to several strategic gaps: 
Further work needed on governance framework 
audit-trails, owners, asset-management 
Lack of common language  /  translations 
Information Model addresses this at higher level only 
need to promote data-naming standards in business context as well as IT 
need for common repository  /  ‘translation’ facilities 
example: ‘Jargon Buster’ intranet section 
Limited awareness of long-term knowledge management 
“How much does it cost an organisation to forget what key employees know, to be unable to answer customer questions quickly or at all, or to make poor decisions based on faulty knowledge?” 
(Tom Davenport, director, Information Management Program, University of Texas at Austin) 
Limited awareness of non-IT data 
integration occurs in haphazard fashion in processes 
no systematic processes to ensure maintenance of non-IT data  (e.g. narrative-knowledge techniques) 
capabilities do exist through organisational culture 
The capabilities we need (roadmap) 
The gaps pointed in turn to this list of the capabilities required to fill those gaps: 
Strategic approach to data management 
Consistent governance of data and information 
Consistent handling of names and translations 
Long-term knowledge-management 
everything changes over time: what must be preserved? 
accuracy, relevance, security, migration, refresh, re-use 
Extend Service Oriented Architecture beyond IT 
process as service: full integration with business process 
Integrate support for human knowledge 
human knowledge provides use and meaning of information 
Capabilities #1: strategic approach to data management 
The remaining slides in the original presentation described the required capabilities in a little more detail, starting with data as a strategic asset: 
Extend concept of information  /  data as asset 
Architecture Principles already established 
Architecture Charter already established 
Establish means for costing data as asset 
e.g. equivalents of capitalisation, depreciation etc 
Capabilities #2: consistent governance of data and information 
The next item was the need for consistent governance: 
Identify information  /  data owners at each level 
Business Strategy 
Business Summary 
Logical 
Technical 
Transaction 
Establish cross-level review forums for all subject-areas 
Establish systematic exit-interviews for all staff and contractors in information  /  data-owner roles 
capture tacit-knowledge on information  /  data and its use 
Capabilities #3: consistent handling of names and translations 
Next was the need to develop and maintain a common language, to support communication across the whole enterprise: 
Establish naming standards 
existing standards include Information Model, Service Naming, Data Naming 
extend these standards towards business usage 
Resolve nomenclature clashes, such as: 
Customer vs Consumer vs Account 
Supply Point vs Market ID 
Location vs Supply Point Address vs Mailing Address 
Establish ‘Jargon Buster’ tool 
reduces ‘acronym blur’, leverages  /  shares local knowledge, aids inter-group translation 
place on intranet (e.g. below ‘find a colleague’) with simple search-box 
‘anyone can post new entry’ – reduces effort, increases staff engagement 
manage as per moderated forum – moderator filters  /  reviews suggested entries 
Capabilities #4: long-term knowledge-management 
Next was a focus on management of data, information and knowledge in the long-term rather than only in the short-term: 
Integrated approach to whole-of-life management of data 
Content: establish clear distinctions and roles for raw data, metadata and connections between data-items 
Accuracy: establish governance for cleanse, de-duplication etc - regular continuous processes, not a ‘once-off project’! 
Data safety: identify and protect the ‘single source of truth’ for each data-item 
Sharing: establish governance of ‘need to know, need to use’ security 
Review: establish governance for regular reviews of data relevance (“who uses this data? in what reports? for what purpose? who uses those reports?”) 
Re-use: establish reviews  /  governance for re-purpose and re-use of data 
Lifetime: establish real data-lifetimes, including processes for planned migration  /  maintenance where these exceed system lifetimes (which they often will) 
Explore how all of these issues change over medium- to long-term 
over time, everything changes: plan for this! 
Capabilities #5: extend Service Oriented Architecture beyond IT 
Next was a need to break free from an IT-centric mindset, by pro-moting a broader understanding of ‘service oriented architecture’ across the whole enterprise: 
Service-oriented approach to process modelling 
clarifies potential for process re-engineering 
identifies potential process  /  resource re-use 
increases resilience of response in event of IT-system failure 
Establish symmetric process  /  data modelling 
data as service to process, process as service to data 
example: data  /  resource ‘services’ in BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) and BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) process-models 
this type of cross-domain integration helps to improve business take-up of enterprise-architecture concepts 
Capabilities #6: integrate support for human knowledge 
And finally a reminder that the meaning of business information comes from people, not machines – so we need to provide support for people to derive and share that meaning: 
Establish stronger awareness that IT-stored data is only one subset of overall organisational knowledge 
Provide active support for capture and sharing of people-based ‘tacit knowledge’

Using SWOT and SCORE 
Ideally, we should replace SWOT entirely with SCORE: it’s more versatile, and has a much stronger emphasis on effectiveness. But it does take more time than a SWOT, and in many cases requires a better grasp of the enterprise as a whole – a broader awareness which may not be available, whether we need it or not. 
So it is also possible to use SWOT and SCORE together: accept SWOT’s limitations, and use it where appropriate – but only where appropriate. For example, use SWOT if: 
speed and simplicity have a high priority 
the context of the strategic issue has only narrow scope and a relatively short time-frame 
in a complex context, the chosen solution will be applied within known ‘safe-fail’ bounds 
Use SCORE in place of SWOT if: 
the impact of the issue will cross boundaries between domains and ‘silos’ 
the issue has a longer time-frame – especially if measured in months or years 
overall effectiveness has a high priority 
in a complex context, there is no clear ‘safe-fail’ 
In short, SCORE is a valuable tool, but it’s not a panacea – it’s just one method amongst many in the management toolkit. Used well, though, and used appropriately, you’re likely to find it one of the most versatile techniques for enhancing enterprise effectiveness. 
SEMPER 
Overview 
There’s an old saying in business that “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”. Whilst that’s not entirely true, there’s no doubt that having some kind of metric usually makes management much easier. The catch is that most conventional metrics such as finan-cial performance, return on investment, productivity, error rates and customer-satisfaction indices are all lag-indicators, or measurements of past performance. Using those metrics alone is like trying to drive the enterprise by looking in the rear-view mirror. 
Instead, what we need most for management are lead-indicators, describing the structural elements that drive future performance. The SEMPER metric combines the themes of the previous chapters – the dimensions of effectiveness and relevance, and how they interact with each other – as a simple method to measure the available ‘ability to do work’ in the enterprise. In effect, SEMPER measures integration and performance at the innerstructure level, describing the productive capability of the entire enterprise. This provides us with a real-time ‘dashboard’ that tells us where the enterprise is going – not just where it’s been. 
This in turn points to interventions which, although they usually apply to specific and localised issues, still always act on the enter-prise as a whole.  So whilst the conventional metrics will always be important, and useful in their own ways in the right context, the picture provided by a SEMPER assessment may well be the only one that really matters. 
Principles 
The core idea in SEMPER is that a measure of ‘ability to do work’ is the key lead-indicator for enterprise capability, and hence for future performance as measured by conventional lag-indicators such as profit and the like. We measure that ‘ability to do work’ in different dimensions of the enterprise, and also measure how well 
these different dimensions support each other, as an indicator of enterprise effectiveness. 
The term SEMPER acronym itself comes from the six core themes that need to be addressed in working with an organisation’s inner-structure: 
Spiritual or aspirational assets – issues such as morale, culture, identity and purpose 
Emotional or relational assets – issues such as reputation, values, relationships and brands 
Mental or conceptual assets – issues such as enterprise knowledge, intellectual property and innovation 
Physical or behavioural assets – issues such as skills, resources and work-environment 
Effectiveness – issues such as efficiency, reliability, focus and direction 
Relevance – issues such as scale, perspective, scope and balance 
If the term ‘spiritual’ seems uncomfortable in a business context (see p.9), use the alternative reverse-acronym for SEMPER: System Effectiveness Map for Process Evaluation and Review. 
‘Semper’ is also the Latin word for ‘always’ – a reminder that these themes underpin everything that the enterprise is and does. 
In the simpler SEMPER-5 variant of the diagnostic – see SEMPER-5 (p.71)  - we use the five domains of the 5Ps framework – see Five Elements (p.19). In the full SEMPER-11 version – see SEMPER-11 (p.100) – we derive the dimensions from the four axes and six link-themes of the tetradian, with an extra domain to measure integration across the whole – see The dimensions of the enterprise (p8). 
We cross-reference each of these domains, recursively, with the dimensions of effectiveness – see Effectiveness acronyms – REAL and LEARN (p.11). This gives us a set of twenty-five subdomains in SEMPER-5, or fifty-five in SEMPER-11, within which we could assess ‘ability to do work’. 
And in both SEMPER variants, but in SEMPER-11 especially, we use the R5 principles from systems-theory – see Reviewing relevance (p.15) – to assess how each facet of the enterprise links in with the whole. 
After assessment we look at intervention-design. In both SEMPER variants, each domain and subdomain is mapped to known tech-niques or models that address the respective issues – see ‘Assessment and interventions’ in SEMPER-5 (p. 74) and ‘Assess-ment and interventions’ in SEMPER-11 (p.100). But we don’t have to start from the ‘problem area’: we can, in principle, start anywhere. 
This is another factor that distinguishes SEMPER from most conventional consultancy models. By its nature, integration can start anywhere, in any domain, and expand outward from there. 
Unfortunately, the same is also true of disintegration – which is why any ‘red flag’ issues identified in a SEMPER assessment need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. 
This ‘start anywhere’ principle makes it possible to avoid a common danger with intervention design, in that tackling a major ‘problem’ head-on may easily inflame the issues instead, either making a difficult situation worse, or causing serious con-sequences elsewhere in the enterprise. With the start-anywhere principle, it’s possible instead to find a related issue that’s close to the known problem, and leverage the strengths in that domain to resolve the problem-issues in a more gentle and indirect way. The tetradian’s dimensions and link-themes also form pathways that can suggest alternative routes to the same end. 
A real-world example. In one of our engagements, in an organisation going through a period of unexpected expansion, the SEMPER assessment identified warning-signs of dwindling standards of service, and breakdown of the staff into feuding ‘tribes’ – in other words issues in the SEMPER-11 domains of responsibility and relationship. There was also an opportunistic attitude to strategy – bringing short-term benefits but creating difficulties elsewhere – which pointed to potential flaws in the domain of sense-making and foresight. 
On the plus side, the assessment showed that there were real strengths in some aspects of leadership-by-example, and in demonstrated commitment to enterprise values. 
The ‘start anywhere’ principle suggested a two-pronged approach to the problems: 
- using values to move up into the aspirational domain, to recreate and reinforce an intentionally inclusive sense of organisational identity that could unify the ‘tribes’; and 

- developing and supporting an emphasis on personal leadership as a source of personal pride in work. 


An Open Space event involving staff from all levels and all business-units – in other words focussing on narrative and dialogue as a bridge between relations and knowledge – also helped to resolve the strategy issues, and created a new sense of engagement throughout the enterprise. 
It worked well – very well. A year later, that organisation became the market leader in its field, and has remained there ever since – though we can’t claim all of the credit for that, of course! 
The advantage of SEMPER and the start-anywhere principle is that it provides a consistent framework to manage this complexity, and guide the process of selecting appropriate tools and tech-niques. There’s more detail later on how to use SEMPER for this kind of organisational transformation and development; but first, we need to explore how to use SEMPER for assessing overall effectiveness. 
Assessment 
Assessment can be carried out using either of the two current variants: SEMPER-5 and SEMPER-11. 
SEMPER-5 – see SEMPER-5, p.71 – is a simpler variant for quick assessments and for more general use. Based on the Five Elements version of the framework, and with a simplified scoring system, it can be used with only minimal training – the material in this book should suffice as a start. By mapping between Five Elements and the full tetradian, results from SEMPER-5 assessments are upwards-compatible: in the software-based versions, SEMPER-5 data-sets can be imported direct into a SEMPER-11 data-set. 
SEMPER-11 – see SEMPER-11, p.100 – is a more advanced variant based on the full tetradian version of the framework. It’s best used by experienced consultants, as the scoring system requires a good understanding of systems-theory and organisational complexity. But it does provide a richer mapping between domains and actions, to support more precise targeting of interventions. The inclusion of the tetradian link-themes in the assessment also permits a broader range of choices for alternative interventions in the more difficult cases – those with many low ‘1’- or ‘2’-type scores. 
The overall SEMPER framework is language-independent, and largely culture-independent, but may be too abstract for general 
use on its own. Both SEMPER-11 and SEMPER-5 simplify this by using a cue-pHRase to describe each pairing of domain and effectiveness category. SEMPER-5 simplifies scoring still further with a set of descriptive pHRases or ‘word-pictures’ that typify each score-level in each domain and category. 
Ideally, the cue-pHRases and ‘word-pictures’ should be derived by narrative techniques from within the enterprise itself, reflecting its own unique language and culture. However, the default pHRase-sets used in this book should be adequate for basic use in most English-speaking cultures. 
The purpose of the cue-pHRases and (in SEMPER-11) assessment-questions for each domain, and the generic relevance-questions that apply to all domains, is to evoke a deeper understanding of the issues in the respective context, and how they affect the effectiveness and integration of the whole. 
In practice, though, the questions may sometimes not work well straight from the page. For example, a cue-pHRase such as “How are the boundaries of ‘We’ maintained?” makes sense within the SEMPER framework, but to many people it might at first seem meaningless. So with SEMPER-11 especially, it may be necessary to translate a cue-pHRase into terms that make more sense within the context. For example, “What do you do to make sure that new people fit in with the way you do things here?”, or “What help do you get to stand your ground if you’re being pressured by a business partner to take part in a dodgy deal?” – and weave it into an ordinary conversation about more everyday matters. 
Both variants provide background information and questions to support the assessment. Both allow the assessment to be carried out in any sequence as appropriate, whilst still ensuring that all domains of the assessment are evaluated. And both variants are each available in a manual format – see SEMPER-5 assessment, p.87 and SEMPER-11 assessment, p.121 – or as an internet or intranet application – see, for example, www.sempermetrics.com. 
As a consultancy tool, SEMPER can be used to guide both assessment and intervention. It can be applied iteratively over any period of time, in any appropriate sequence, to any required depth. The basic SEMPER process is as follows: 
1. Select an initial SEMPER domain to assess – either an issue chosen by the client or indicated in preliminary discussion, or the default of ‘Aspirations’. 

2. Explore the issues in that theme, using the questions indicated for the domain. 

3. Use the LEARN keywords (elegant, efficient, appropriate, reliable, integrated) to evaluate effectiveness in the context. 

4. Use the R5 principles (recursion, rotation, reflexion, reciprocation, resonance) to explore the issues in greater depth, and to assess their integration with the whole. 

5. Assign a 1-5 score to each pairing of domain and effectiveness-category, with an optional adjustment (+1 for improving, 0 for stable, -1 for worsening) to indicate probable future trends for each. 

6. Select another domain, either from the sequence shown on the paper form or in the software application, or by following any of the trails to related dimensions, link-themes or overall integration. 

7. Repeat until all appropriate issues in all domains have been addressed. 


The same iterative process is used for assessment and for inter-vention design. In practice, a SEMPER assessment is also a kind of intervention, as the act of assessment and evaluation itself brings issues to light and provides pointers towards their resolution. 
The end-result of the assessment for a domain is a set of scores on a 1-5 scale (see Scoring an assessment below), each matched to the respective cue-pHRase. This provides a visual summary of effectiveness issues throughout the whole context, and a data-set that can be aggregated and re-used in many different ways. 
The basic tabular summary lists the results for the assessment in a standard report-layout, optionally including any comments and trends as well as the basic score for each assessment-statement. Since SEMPER covers every aspect of the innerstructure, including its overall integration, the summary provides a literal ‘balanced scorecard’ for the context. In the software-based versions, the evaluations are colour-coded, so that any ‘1’ or ‘2’ scores are immediately visible as ‘red-flag’ issues – ‘deal-killers’ that put the whole enterprise at risk and need urgent attention.  
The software versions also provide an alternative single-page ‘dashboard’ view of the assessment, laid out in grid form, with domains providing one axis and the effectiveness-keywords the other axis. An optional second grid shows the future results 
predicted by the recorded trends, providing an immediate visual comparison of the organisation’s trends. 
Scoring an assessment 
The scoring system used in all SEMPER variants is based on a power-model that highlights a key dichotomy about power and work: in physics, power is defined as ‘the ability to do work’, whereas in many social contexts power is essentially defined as ‘the ability to avoid work’, or to entrap others into doing the respective work. The social definition is dysfunctional or ‘power-against’, as it creates a negative resonance towards a ‘lose / lose’ – usually seen either as the illusory ‘win / lose’ or the less-common ‘lose / win’ – from which eventually everyone loses. By contrast, the physics definition is functional or ‘power-with’, in that it supports positive resonance leading towards a ‘win / win’ from which everyone gains. (See the glossary in Appendix A: Glossary, p.133, for more details on these terms.) 
For convenience, the SEMPER scoring system places this range from strong negative resonance to strong positive on a simple 1-5 scale, as summarised below: 
5: Excellent (full-scope effective) 
Summary: systematic, conscious, context-aware use of emergent  /  collective techniques, self-propagating and linking with other domains [the ideal as a ‘start anywhere’ area] 
Power-themes: power-from-within to power-with – individual to collective 
Competence category: unconscious-competence 
Commitment: wholeness-responsibility 
Decision-style: co-creating 
Scoring suggestions: assign a ‘5’ when this aspect is not only well supported, but it either helps the integration of other domains, or can be used as an example in developing other domains or in other effectiveness-categories in the same domain. 
a ‘5’ score will typically occur only in some aspects of some domains: for example, a strong focus on customer service enhancing quality and personal responsibility throughout the whole organisation, or a well-established ‘credo’ defining the organisation’s vision and values. 
4: Good (local effective) 
Summary: includes use of emergent  /  collective techniques such as self-organised teams, scenarios, diversity and the like, but often in a fragmentary way, not integrated with other domains, and often without a theoretical framework to link it to others [may be used as an example  /  leverage if no ‘5’ is available] 
Power-themes: power-with to power-from-within – collective to in-dividual 
Competence category: conscious-competence 
Commitment: functional diversity 
Decision-style: consulting 
Scoring suggestions: assign a ‘4’ when this aspect is working well, but could probably do with further improvement at some stage, especially in links to other domains. 
a ‘4’ score will be more common than a ‘5’, and would be typical for most aspects of high-performing organisations and for the best aspects of average ones. 
3: Acceptable (efficient) 
Summary: efficient up to the limit of analytic  /  predictable – the benchmark or Best Practice level – but often applied without much awareness of the broader context [stable, but could be improved] 
Power-themes: power-neutral – dysfunction is counterbalanced by functional power 
Competence category: plateau of control 
Commitment: ‘best practice’ 
Decision-style: testing 
Scoring suggestions: assign a ‘3’ when this aspect is neither a hindrance nor much of a help, though attention to improve it would probably be described as ‘important but not urgent’. 
a ‘3’ score is typical for most domains in average-performing organisations: good enough to get by but not capable on its own of supporting stellar performance. Quite often, though, careful attention on just one or two of these ‘3’ issues will be enough to lift the entire organisation to a whole new order of performance and effectiveness. 
2: Below needs (passive dysfunction) 
Summary: should be efficient in the local context, but will create imbalance passively due to lack of integration with other areas [needs to be addressed to prevent decline] 
Power-themes: power-under – evasion of responsibility 
Competence category: conscious-incompetence 
Commitment: compartments  /  silos 
Decision-style: selling 
Scoring suggestions: assign a ‘2’ when weakness in this aspect of the domain is having significant impact on overall effectiveness, and needs attention as soon as practicable to prevent a downward spiral. 
a ‘2’ score usually arises from too narrow a focus, and lack of awareness of the impact of local actions on the workings of the whole – the classic effect of over-specialisation and poor support for generalists, resulting in disconnected ‘silos’ and private fiefdoms. 
all ‘2’ scores should be flagged as ‘significant’ issues in the assessment-summary, and need to be resolved before overall effectiveness can be improved. 
1: Poor (active dysfunction) 
Summary: evidence of serious power-problems – some aspect actively creating imbalance, and ‘infecting’ other domains [placing organisation at risk – needs urgent attention 
Power-themes: power-over – self over others 
Competence category: unconscious-incompetence 
Commitment: fragmentation 
Decision-style: telling 
Scoring suggestions:  assign a ‘1’ when weakness in this area is not only causing serious damage to overall effectiveness, but is ‘infecting’ other aspects of the domain or other domains, and needs urgent attention to resolve. 
a ‘1’ score usually arises from some form of power imbalance deep within the organisation’s innerstructure. Such issues place the entire enterprise at risk, and are the most common cause of organisational failure: classic examples include mismatch between espoused and actual values, a predatory 
attitude to customers, employees and other stakeholders, complacency and ‘groupthink’ as a substitute for strategic foresight, or even basic management issues such as poor cost control. 
all ‘1’ scores should be flagged as ‘serious’ issues in the assessment-summary, and will require urgent attention. However, by their nature, such issues are often denied and ‘undiscussable’, resulting in classic ‘fire-fighting’, lurching from crisis to crisis and always looking outside for something to save the day – a ‘hero’ manager, perhaps, or the next in an endless succession of management fads – anything, in fact, to avoid facing the deeper issues within the organisation itself. Designing and implementing successful interventions for these intractable issues will invariably prove to be the hardest part of any business-integration process. 
Notes on scoring 
Although the cue-pHRase is different in each domain, in effect each represents a domain-specific way to express the same questions about effectiveness in the overall context: 
Is the activity in this domain efficient? – it maximises the return and minimises the use of energies and resources 
Is it reliable? – it can be relied upon to deliver the required results 
Is it elegant? – it supports the human factors in the domain 
Is it appropriate? – it supports the overall purpose and minimises distractions from that purpose 
Is it integrated with the whole? – it links with, supports and is supported by the other domains 
For example, the aim of the cue-pHRase “Identity and purpose consistently described and maintained” is to provide a way to assess whether the processes that apply to this domain – ‘Aspirations’, the domain of identity and purpose – can be relied upon to support and maintain identity and purpose for the whole context. 
The generic ‘Relevance’ questions in SEMPER-11 aim to provide reminders about scale, perspective, balance and the like. Using the same example, this means that identity and purpose need to apply and be supported at every level, from the individual, to the work-group, the department, the business-unit and so on, and that 
these need to link between and support all levels and perspectives – not just the identity and purpose of one group of stakeholders, such as management, unions, customers, suppliers or shareholders. 
In reality, every cue-pHRase relates, if only in part, to issues that are intangible and all but unmeasurable. This especially applies to links between domains. Yet even if they are ‘unmeasurable’, it is still possible and useful to form an opinion – in other words, make a subjective yet considered assessment – about how well that aspect of the domain is working in relation to the whole. In SEMPER-5, the scoring decision is simplified by limiting the range of assessment to a ‘closest match’ to one of five alternative descriptions. Backed up where necessary by additional comments, this provides both a qualitative summary for the domain and a simple 1-5 scale that can be used for overall scores. 
In SEMPER-11 especially, each assessment involves a balance of many different factors. For example, if all levels of employees are engaged in developing vision and strategy, you would probably assign a score of ‘3’ or even a ‘4’ for the respective cue-pHRase; but you might reduce this to a ‘2’ if there is a strong ‘us versus them’ attitude toward suppliers or customers, and definitely to a ‘1’ if the only declared ‘purpose’ is that of ‘enhancing shareholder value’, as this is likely to weaken the commitment of everyone involved (with the possible exception of senior management). 
If in doubt, score one level lower than your initial evaluation. This may seem pessimistic, but it counters a natural tendency towards wishful thinking, and in most cases is more realistic than scoring upwards. 
Note too that the wider culture will also play an important part in the overall context, and hence needs to be taken into account in your assessment. At present, the reality is that many aspects of the mainstream economic, legal and business frameworks at local, national, regional and global levels all actively degrade enterprise effectiveness, and all but mandate organisational failure within a relatively short period. (This assertion may at first sound extreme, but it soon becomes self-evident from the broader perspective of SEMPER.) Most commercial organisations that follow a ‘business-as-usual’ paradigm, with its over-focus on the financial bottom line and its emphasis on efficiency over effectiveness, would be likely to score a ‘2’ or even a ‘1’ in several different aspects, especially in relation to aspirational themes 
around identity and purpose, and appropriate management and maintenance of intangible assets. 
As a general guideline, an organisation needs to score at least a ‘4’ in more than half of the assessment criteria, with no worse than a ‘2’ in any area, before sustainable excellence can be achieved. That this needs to be done within a wider milieu which not only rarely supports this, but often actively works against it, is one of the most interesting challenges for present-day business leaders. 
It’s important to understand that the framework describes only the impact of each of these levels on overall effectiveness – not necessarily that a ‘5’ level is always to be desired. In general, ‘2’- and, especially ‘1’-type responses are likely to cause problems, and should be minimised wherever practicable; but some com-pliance-areas, such as occupational health and safety, medicine and the law, will necessarily restrict personal choice and personal responsibility, and hence mandate that a ‘3’-type would usually be the highest achievable level in that context. 
Aggregations – using multiple perspectives 
A single SEMPER assessment in itself provides a useful ‘dash-board’ view. SEMPER’s design draws out the characteristic reflexion of all complex-systems, so even a single perspective will still portray a meaningful and valid view of the whole enterprise. Yet often the greatest value comes from aggregations which combine or compare data from several different assessments. The key types of aggregations are: 
comparison – two or more assessment-summaries shown side by side in tabular form 
chart – as for comparison, but with assessment-summaries overlaid as graph-lines or as a shaded ‘river diagram’ 
statistical map – mapping across a broader set of assessments, showing minima, median / mean and maxima 
Some examples of applications include: 
comparison over time – a dashboard used to compare assessments of the same context by quarter, year or other interval, to show changes over time 
whole-of-organisation – a statistical dashboard showing the overall ‘effectiveness health’ of the organisation across all departments and business units, highlighting any ‘red flag’ 
issues and any potential aspects to support stronger integration 
inside / outside view – a dashboard to compare assessments of the same context by ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’, used for issues such as reputation management, market alignment and construction of value webs 
horizontal scan – views from the same level but different functional areas within the organisation (e.g. all senior executive, or all second-level managers); highlights potential conflicts, assists in whole-of-organisation gap-analysis  
vertical scan – views from different levels within the same functional area; provides direct comparison of different emphases and drivers at the different levels of the organisation, even with the same nominal scope  
spherical scan – views from immediately above, immediately below and at same level as a single chosen context (like 360° feedback); combines horizontal and vertical scans to create an overall picture of potential issues 
An advantage of using SEMPER in place of conventional 360°-feedback techniques is that it reduces the emotional loading: it describes views of a context rather than a person, making apparent criticism easier to accept and address. 
Common statistical techniques can also be used to derive standard deviation and mean scores, though these are perhaps less directly useful than identifying specific areas of concern – especially the crucial ‘1’-type issues. 
In general, any strong disparity between perspectives will point to potential or actual areas of conflict. Consistent low scores across most or all perspectives point to ‘undiscussable’ issues that will need to be addressed by indirect rather than direct tactics.  
Interpretation 
The SEMPER diagnostic describes a view of the whole context from one group’s or person’s perspective. In effect, it provides a means to quantify not just individual performance, but integration and effectiveness of the context as a whole. The scores in each domain and category identify key indicators of effectiveness not only within the specific area, but also in relation to the whole as whole. The optional trend-adjustment for the score provides an 
additional ‘lead-indicator’ for the future, identifying potential pro-blems to be addressed or areas that can be leveraged to improve overall integration, using the key start-anywhere principle of the framework. 
Overall scores 
The overall score provides a useful overview of integration and the potential for further improvement: 
20% or less (20% is minimum-possible score before adjustment for trends): actively dysfunctional in all areas; may be beyond recovery  
20%-30%: severely dysfunctional (commercial organisations usually unprofitable); may be recoverable, but in danger of spiralling beyond recovery; in some cases may be recovered by ‘hidden’ integration techniques such as process / workflow analysis that draws out people-connections and tacit knowledge, but often recoverable only by ‘shock tactics’ that make the dysfunctionality plainly visible and re-emphasise a return to collective purpose  
30%-40%: passively dysfunctional (commercial organisations usually at break-even); often typified by excessive bureaucracy and a ‘silo’ mentality; can usually be improved by integration techniques that leverage successes and acknowledge yet avoid ‘undiscussable’ problem-areas  
40%-50%: functional bureaucracy (commercial organisations usually at peer-average performance); ‘problem’ areas often typified by frustration rather than cynicism and despair; can usually be improved by leveraging a single integration-theme such as quality or innovation to loosen silo-boundaries  
50%-60%: best-practice (commercial organisations usually in upper range of peer-average); can only be improved by loosening the command-and-control mentality and supporting individual responsibility at the rules-versus-guidelines boundary  
60%-70%: beyond efficiency (commercial organisations show clear distance from peers); improvements usually derived from increasing whole-of-system awareness such as recursive relationships with partners and the wider community  
70%-80%: effective responsibility (commercial organisations show consistent long-term higher-than-average performance); 
if achievable, improvements usually derived from emergent ethos and sense of shared destiny  
80%-90%: wholeness responsibility (commercial organisations show quantum performance difference from peers, but often not sustainable); emphasis usually needs to be on sustaining and maintaining rather than attempting further improvement  
90%+: full integration (in general, achievable only for small groups, and usually only for short periods); often desirable to create example for wider whole-of-system improvements, but inherently unstable and unsustainable; emphasis needs to be on acceptance of natural ‘fallback’ to sustainable lower levels when the immediate task is complete 
This indicates that, for a commercial enterprise, a score in the 50%-60% range would be a good result: well below peak potential, but still relatively high by comparison with most of the organisation’s peers. In practice, a 100% score is neither achievable nor, in most cases, even desirable; an overall score of around 80% would be a more realistic target, and probably more sustainable over the longer term. 
As a comparison, the mean score for effectiveness at the societal level is usually around the 40%-50% level, dependent on the con-text. In the business domain, though, the mean may perhaps be as low as 30% or less, given the common insistence on dysfunctional forms of competition and the often extreme emphasis on short-term financial results over any kind of investment for longer-term performance. 
Moving beyond those mean-levels improves performance, but also increases the tension of the natural ‘pull-back’ towards the mean: for example, organisations which place strong emphasis on intangibles – especially people-oriented intangibles such as morale and work / life balance – may place themselves at risk of hostile takeover by other organisations with a more predatory short-term perspective. A lack of understanding at board level of the difference between short-term efficiency and long-term effect-iveness can easily destroy most of an organisation’s capacity for sustainable performance, yet without showing any visible sign of damage for some months or years – a classic longer-term resonance effect in all complex-systems which conceals the real cause of many organisational problems. Sustainable high effect-iveness and high performance is not easy, and for a large enter-
prise almost invariably depends on some kind of unifying ethos or ‘creed’ which provides an enduring sense of mission and purpose. 
Specific scoring issues 
Note that the overall score is a useful a summary, but is often less important than key scores in specific areas, and the overall range of scores. For most enterprises, a typical ‘best’ would consist at least one or two 5s, mostly 4s and 3s, a few 2s, and no 1s. 
A ‘5’-type score is relatively unusual. For best performance, every enterprise needs to find at least one ‘5’, though too many can actually make it less stable. Every ‘5’ represents an area which can be leveraged to maximise effectiveness in every other area. 
A ‘4’ or a ‘3’ represent functional areas with potential opportunities for improvement. 
A ‘2’ represents an issue that needs to be addressed. 
A ‘1’ represents active dysfunctionality which can self-propagate to infect other areas of the enterprise. ‘1’-scores are ‘red flags’: any area showing a ‘1’ score has the potential to destroy the entire enterprise, and must be resolved as soon as possible. The difficulty is that any attempt to tackle ‘1’-type issues directly will further inflame the problems; in practice, as described later, they can be tackled safely only by working on less-inflamed areas around them. 
Another key concern is the disparity of scores in different areas. High disparity will highlight common sources of ‘unexpected’ instability, whereas low disparity – especially where all the scores are low – often indicates potential difficulty in identifying suitable areas to leverage for improvement. Some SEMPER-5 examples: 
commercial organisations tend to be stronger in the Preparation, Process and Performance domains, but often at risk in the People and especially the Purpose domains  
government and non-profit organisations tend to be either very high in the People domain (or very low – indicating political problems), but are often weak in the Process or Performance domains  
academic organisations tend to over-emphasise the Purpose domain (nothing gets started, let alone finished) or Preparation domain (resulting in ‘analysis paralysis’)  
family organisations and other SMEs tend to have a wider overall disparity than large organisations, reflecting the greater difficulty for smaller organisations to maintain consistent awareness of everything, but in most cases also providing a wider range of opportunity to leverage higher-score areas for improved overall effectiveness 
Suggested actions  
The notes above summarise what the SEMPER-5 diagnostic shows about an enterprise; but what happens next? What would the results suggest we should do differently come Monday morning? In practice, this always depends on which areas are highlighted for action – either because they are weaker, or because they can be leveraged to help lift other aspects of the organisation’s game. 
The most powerful tools to create sustainable improvements are the large-group interventions such as Future Search and Open Space, which operate directly at the ‘5’-type level. However, all of them require facilitators and managers to relinquish control, agendas and outcomes, to allow requirements to emerge from the collective space. Any attempt at control – to force the process back to a more comfortable ‘3’-type level, or below – will not only cause failure, but may well entrench cynicism, ‘change fatigue’ and resistance to further interventions. For the same reason, agreements made during this type of emergent process must always be carried through to completion: if there’s a risk that commitments will be withdrawn, it’s best not to attempt these processes at all. 
Where the problem-area is a ‘1’-type issue, it’s best to not attempt to dive straight in and ‘fix the problem’. ‘1’-type issues are often deeply entrenched and ‘undiscussable’, so hitting them hard – the standard approach in conventional consulting techniques – only makes things worse, often provoking a reaction far out of propor-tion to the event. Instead, as with an inflamed wound, it’s best to tackle them gently, often by deliberately looking away elsewhere – in other words, find another area with a ‘3’-type or above for which the diagnostic shows a ‘hook’ that can link back to the inflamed area, and leverage improvement from there. In SEMPER-11 such alternate paths are shown directly via the six link-themes. With SEMPER-5, choose an area in either the same domain or same 
category that has a higher-level score, linking back to the inflamed area with that domain or category as the ‘hook’. 
For the common ‘2’-type problem of organisational ‘silos’ – “never let the left hand know what the right or middle hands are doing” – the best tactic is an emphasis on the role of the generalist. Every enterprise has people whose natural inclination is to wander from place to place, to talk, exchange ideas and stories, keep track of how things link together. Some such roles are formally recognised – project manager is one example – but most are not. These ‘horizontal’ connections are essential for enterprise integration and effectiveness, but in most cases are thwarted by the ‘vertical’ orientation of enterprise structures. The more that generalists do their real work of creating links and connections, the more they are likely to be penalised for ‘failing’ to perform against what are – for them – entirely the wrong types of performance metrics. 
A common survival-tactic for generalists in large organisations is to shelter under the wing of a powerful patron, often assigned an indefinable title such as ‘ideation manager’ or ‘communications analyst’ that protects them from conventional performance assess-ments. The catch with this tactic is that it remains dependent on the whim and status of the patron: if either are lost, the protection goes with it. Far better to develop performance-metrics for gener-alists that are actually meaningful in practice: never an easy task, but a necessary one if the enterprise wants to move onward. 
Moving beyond a ‘3’-type level – and especially from ‘4’-type to ‘5’-type – is not something that can often be done by incremental improvement: it requires a true quantum jump, a change from one state to an entirely different other. The ‘3’-type level is the best that can be achieved with conventional command-and-control; moving to the ‘4’-type level requires that ‘control’ be dropped, instead recognising the unique attributes of each individual; and moving to the ‘5’-type level requires that ‘command’ be dropped too, allowing wholeness-responsibility to arise from within each individual. This last level of trust is impractical in most organisational contexts: the few commercial organisations with sustained high ‘5’-type levels, such as Ricardo Semler’s Semco, all operate within high-margin niche markets. But for the rest of us, no matter how tightly constrained our environment may be, it’s always possible to have at least one or two ‘5’-type areas, and it’s always something that’s worth striving for: it’s what makes the difference between the good and the truly great. 
From assessment to action 
The aim of the assessment is to identify strengths and challenges within the innerstructure, to guide intervention design and tool selection. Despite the marketing hype of some proponents, no one tool does everything, but each has its value and its place. The table below summarises the scope and limitations of a range of well-known models, books and techniques, in relation to the tetradian’s ten domains.

Enterprise effectiveness depends on ensuring that all the inner-structure domains are fully supported in the overall operations and activities of the enterprise. As the table shows, each tool or tech-nique focusses most of its attention on one or two domains, occasionally more. (Large-group intervention techniques such as Open Space and World Café cover the widest range of domains, but in general are only practicable as ‘events’ rather than everyday work-processes.) So in practice, every enterprise will need to use a variety of techniques and approaches, in different combinations as appropriate, to cover all domains. 
The key to effectiveness lies in linking different and often disparate techniques together to support the whole. If this integration is not done, the result is a succession of short-term ‘management fads’, each introduced with high hopes and great excitement, only to fade away after a mere few months, and all too often in a welter of recrimination, blame and renewed cynicism. Lack of systematic integration is also one of the primary reasons why organisations fragment into dissociated ‘silos’ and fiefdoms. It’s only when there’s a renewed awareness of the whole as whole that the un-necessary boundaries start to dissolve, and stronger effectiveness becomes possible. 
Interestingly, it’s the secondary domains that are often most im-portant in this, particularly in the relational domain and its link-themes, as they provide ‘hooks’ to attach other tools, creating a seamless integration. When these ‘hooks’ are absent – as in most implementations of business process reengineering – the stage is set for an almost inevitable failure. For other models, and even to some extent for BPR, the problem was more in implementation than in design: for example, key aspirational and relational themes in Deming’s concept of quality management – such as the need for clear vision, and his exhortation to “drive out fear!” – were watered down in TQM, and all but lost from the earlier versions of ISO9000. It’s only recently that the importance of the relational domains in sharing of tacit knowledge has been fully recognised in mainstream implementations of knowledge management. 
The advantage of SEMPER here is that it does not seek to replace any existing tools and techniques; instead, it provides new ways to leverage what the organisation already knows and does. SEMPER 
can be used as an intervention technique in its own right, especially in the strategy and foresight area; but its main use is to provide a framework in which existing tools at last do make practical sense. 
SEMPER-5  
Overview  
Use and interpretation of the full SEMPER-11 diagnostic requires specialist skills, especially in assessments for large, complex organisations. Yet there’s also a clear need for a simpler metric which covers the same overall scope, but which is more closely matched to the needs and experience of general business users. 
SEMPER-5 fills this gap. It is particularly appropriate as a means to collect quick ‘snapshot’ views of the organisation, often for re-use in aggregations such as cross-departmental ‘scorecards’ and 360° feedback. Assessments created with SEMPER-5 are also upwards compatible with the full SEMPER model. 
The Legal Bit: we’ve used SEMPER extensively for some years now, so we know it works, but we can’t be liable for its use by others outside of our control. Commonsense applies: all reasonable care has been taken, but use it at your own risk etc etc. Fair enough? 
Structure  
To understand what SEMPER-5 describes, it’s useful to review the SEMPER framework that underlies it. As we’ve seen, the tetradian describes the enterprise in terms of four distinct dimensions: 
behavioural or physical – the facilities and capabilities of the enterprise, and actions and experiences of individual people  
conceptual or mental – the shared knowledge, beliefs and systems of the enterprise, and the knowledge and ideas of individual people  
relational or emotional – the shared relationships of the enterprise within itself and with its outside stakeholders and other organisations, and the relationships and interactions of individual people  
aspirational or spiritual – shared and personal aspirations, vision, values, purpose and culture across the enterprise  
There is also a hidden ‘fifth dimension’, the process of integration which links those four dimensions into a unified whole. 
SEMPER-11 provides an assessment in each of these domains, and also in each of the six link-themes that act as the ‘bridges’ between each pair of the four dimensions – for example, active learning, which bridges the behavioural and conceptual dimensions. For simplicity, SEMPER-5 follows the Five Elements structure (see p.19): it merges the tetradian link-themes into the base domains, and uses a slightly different mapping of dimensions that is easier to match to common organisational structures. This is summarised in the following table.

SEMPER-5 domains 
In principle, through reflexion, every domain occurs in every part and every level of the organisation. In practice, though, different organisational functions tend to emphasise specific domains: 
purpose: emphasised in strategy, research and development, and some aspects of marketing  
people: emphasised in personnel / human resources, marketing and public relations  
preparation: emphasised in business development, planning, scheduling, distribution, training and performance-support systems  
process: emphasised in manufacture, production and sales  
performance: emphasised in sales-fulfilment, accounts, record-keeping, performance measures 
In each case, the respective business-functions need to score high in their ‘preferred’ SEMPER-5 domains, since they are in effect ‘holding the flag’ for that domain on behalf of the organisation. (If not, this is in itself a clear source of problems for the organisation.) Any other domains that are scored high provide useful ‘hooks’ to support closer integration with the related business functions. 
Integration-functions such as quality, IT, OH&S, logistics, facilities and infrastructure need (though are rarely allowed) a near-equal emphasis on all five domains. 
For each domain, the SEMPER-5 diagnostic presents a set of cue-pHRases which form the framework for the scoring. The statements are split into five categories, which map recursively to the original SEMPER dimensions. The domains provide a function oriented perspective, whilst the categories describe how those same themes tend to be expressed in practice within a single function. 
The effectiveness categories thus provide an alternate view of the same issues, seen from a different perspective. The mapping is not as precise in SEMPER-5 as it is in SEMPER-11, but still delivers a similar result: a kind of self-reflecting 360° feedback on the context as a whole. 

Category 
 Tagline 
 Associated domain 
 

Efficient  
 “makes best use of energies and resources”  
 Preparation  /  Performance [conceptual]  
 

Reliable  
 “delivers expected results consistently and sustainably”  
 Process [physical]  
 

Elegant  
 “supports the human elements within the context”  
 People [relational]  
 

Appropriate  
 “supports and is aligned to the overall purpose”  
 Purpose [aspirational]  
 

Integrated  
 “linked to, supports and supported by all other domains”  
 (integration) [‘soul’ of the enterprise]  
 

SEMPER-5 effectiveness categories 
Significant disparity between the two perspectives – categories within domains, or domains within categories – implies the same kind of warning as for disparity within a single perspective. For example, all low-scores in one category, such as ‘Appropriate’, indicates the same kind of problems as for low scores in the matching ‘Purpose’ domain. Conversely, higher scores in one category (in a commercial organisation, often ‘Efficient’ or ‘Reliable’) in an otherwise low-scored domain can act as ‘hooks’ into the matching domain (in this example, either ‘Preparation’  /  ‘Performance’ or ‘Process’ respectively), providing opportunities to leverage existing successes and competencies in lower-scoring domains. For examples of how to put this into practice, see ‘Suggested actions’ in SEMPER (p.66). 
Assessment and interventions 
The following notes summarise assessment and suggested inter-vention techniques for each ‘cell’ – pairing of domain and category – in SEMPER-5. The matching tetradian link-theme is shown in brackets after the cell-name; note that link-themes may apply to several cells, or be split across different cells. 
To conduct the assessment, select an appropriate starting cell, dependent on the key issue or problem. (For general overviews, start at the beginning of the 5Ps cycle, with the ‘Purpose / Efficient’ cell.) Then: 
using the cell’s cue-pHRase and the respective notes below as a guide, review the selected context; in particular, note the pHRases and other language that people tend to use in describing their experience of that context 
from the example descriptions provided for the cell, select the pHRase which most closely matches the ‘flavour’ within that context; mark the respective score appropriately on the diagnostic [on the paper form, circle the respective score; on the online version, select the descriptive pHRase from the dropdown list] 
optionally, assign a trend-adjustment for each score: +1 for improving, 0 for stable, or -1 for worsening [on the paper form, write the respective trend-adjustment; on the online version, select the trend-value from the dropdown list] 
move to the next cell, following the sequence of domains or categories as appropriate 
Repeat this sequence until all cells have been assessed. 
See SEMPER-5 assessment (p.87) for a set of example forms that can be used for SEMPER-5 assessments.

Cue-pHRase: “Tasks, skills, facilities and resources support purpose” 
Summary: “Resources, actions, environment and support are aligned to the overall purpose”: look for clear distinctions between efficiency and effectiveness; also for support for individual as well as collective purpose, for promotion and cultural support of ‘fuzzy’ boundaries between roles, and for development and 
reinforcement of personal responsibility in achieving collective outcomes. 
Scoring issues: Score high for focus on effectiveness in relation to purpose, on shared responsibility and on ‘big picture’ awareness; score low for rigid task-oriented job descriptions, lack of autonomy in executing work, or over-focus on efficiency for its own sake. 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
strategic review – SWOT, SCORE etc 
large-group interventions (e.g. Future Search)  
Process  /  Integrated (Feedback) 

Cue-pHRase: “Work-processes provide a focus for the whole enterprise” 
Summary: “Competencies, facilities and resources support purpose, relationships and overall effectiveness”: look at leadership processes, at support for ‘shop floor’ innovation and whole-of-enterprise workflow optimisation, and for generalists who provide links across organisational ‘silos’. 
Scoring issues: Score high for self-directed work-teams and other cross-functional integration; score low for rigid boundaries and ‘turf wars’. 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
ISO-9000:2000 
post-compliance TQM  
Performance - bringing it all together 

Themes: benchmarks, scorecards, dashboards  
 
Performance  /  Efficient (Tactics) 

Cue-pHRase: “Beliefs and business models support overall integration” 
Summary: “The organisation makes the best use of all its energies and resources”: look at impact and implications of mindsets, beliefs and mental-models on overall integration; in particular, identify energies and intangible resources that may be ignored or under-acknowledged, such as reputation, morale, commitment and personal knowledge. 
Scoring issues: Score high if performance indicators include human and other intangible elements; score low for narrow-focus models such as ‘enterprise as money-machine’; also score low if models tend to create fragmentation or if support for generalists is poor. 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
benchmarking 
real-time ‘dashboards’ 
integration frameworks  
Performance  /  Reliable (Feedback) 

Cue-pHRase: “Everyone is involved in system-wide feedback and reflection” 
Summary: “Bringing everything together delivers sustainable results”: look for whole-of-organisation processes to leverage past experience for future growth and development. 
Scoring issues: Score high for use of large-group interventions and systematic knowledge-sharing for process optimisation; score low for rigid top-down command-and-control management styles. 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
enterprise-wide ‘dashboards’ 
interactive intranet  /  extranet (e.g. wiki, chat, conferencing) 
narrative and dialogue 
large-group interventions (e.g. Open Space)  
Performance  /  Elegant (Narrative) 

Cue-pHRase: “Integration supports diversity of skills, background and experience” 
Summary: “Bringing it all together supports the human elements”: look at balance between uniformity and diversity, organisational support for and use of diversity in strategy and decision-making, and mutual respect and inclusion of cultures and subcultures; also look at support for personal integration, such as meditation, study sabbaticals and work / life balance. 
Scoring issues: Score high for explicit use and management of di-versity, and active support for personal integration and work / life balance; score low for imposed uniformity, for ‘work-only’ culture or for breakdown into fragmented ‘tribes’ 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
equity / diversity policy  /  practice 
complexity-system techniques (e.g. Cynefin  /  Cognitive Edge)  
Performance  /  Appropriate (Foresight) 

Cue-pHRase: “Metrics indicate when the organisation is effective and ‘on purpose’” 
Summary: “Bringing it all together supports the overall purpose”: look for clear distinctions between ‘efficient’ and ‘effective’, and at processes for whole-of-organisation optimisation and for linking people and practice to purpose; also look for events and symbols of overall integration or for celebrations of organisational ‘heroes’ and actions which exemplify enterprise vision and values. 
Scoring issues: Score high for performance metrics linked to purpose; score low for over-focus on local efficiency at the expense of overall effectiveness. 
Typical intervention models and techniques: 
real-time ‘dashboards’ 
performance in relation to standard maturity-models 
values  /  performance review  
Performance  /  Integrated (Power / Property / Responsibility) 

Cue-pHRase: “Appropriate metrics support overall integration” 
Summary: “Performance indicators link everything together”: look at reporting criteria and scope of performance indicators, partic-ularly for intangibles; also at distinctions between lag- and lead-indicators, and usefulness and usability of metrics to guide pro-active strategy and the forward view. 
Scoring issues: Score high for multi-axis reporting and emphasis on lead-indicators; score low for narrow focus on financials and other lag-indicators.

SEMPER-11 
Overview 
SEMPER-11 – also known as Standard SEMPER – provides a more detailed view of the enterprise innerstructure and its present and likely future condition, its overall ‘ability to do work’. 
Note, though, that unlike the simple pick-from-a-list scoring in SEMPER-5, scoring in SEMPER-11 relies on a detailed personal assessment of the entire context by the consultant, and is likely to have a much broader impact on the enterprise. 
In practice, the assessment needs to draw on experience from a very broad range of domains, including complexity-science, general-systems theory, organisational psychology, narrative knowledge and many other specialist sources. So although I’ve included SEMPER-11 in this book for completeness, and to give a taste of what is possible with the full SEMPER framework, I need to warn you that it really should be used only by accredited practitioners. 
You’re welcome to experiment with SEMPER-11 as-is, as described here, but only on the proviso that the results are out of our control, and cannot be guaranteed. Fair enough? 
The end-result of the diagnostic is a ‘dashboard’ of the current state of the enterprise. 
By mapping tools and techniques to SEMPER-11 domains, the diagnostic also provides a means to target interventions with more precision than is usually available with conventional approaches. 
Structure 
A SEMPER-11 assessment covers eleven distinct domains, as defined by the tetradian framework: 
the four dimensions: behavioural / physical, conceptual / mental, relational / emotional, and aspirational / spiritual; 
the six link-themes between those dimensions: vision and values, leadership, active learning, narrative and dialogue, sensemaking and foresight, responsibility and empowerment; and 
an overview-domain of integration between all the dimensions and link-themes. 
The assessment asks the same five questions about the effective-ness of activities in the domain: 
Is it efficient? 
Is it reliable? 
Is it elegant? 
Is it appropriate? 
Is it integrated well with other domains? 
In the SEMPER-11 diagnostic, these questions are presented as cue-pHRases, matched to the respective issues in the domain. Each domain can be assessed separately, with the assessment supported by other exploratory questions about the domain, and generic ‘relevance’ questions which apply to all domains. 
Assessment and interventions 
The following notes summarise assessment criteria for each SEMPER-11 domain, and questions to review the relevance of each context to the whole. Each section also describes typical business issues that are associated with the respective domain, examples of models and techniques commonly used to address issues in that domain, and the kinds of benefits that would result from doing so. 
To conduct the assessment, select a starting domain, dependent on the identified issue or ‘problem’. Then: 
1. explore the selected domain, using the questions indicated by the domain 


use the generic relevance questions derived from the R5 keywords (recursion, rotation, reflexion, reciprocation, resonance) to explore in greater depth [note: because these questions are generic to all domains, they are on a separate linked page at the end of the summaries] 
use that domain’s variant of the LEARN keywords (efficient, reliable, elegant, appropriate, integrated) to evaluate the context, using a 1-5 scale for each; mark the score appropriately on the diagnostic [on the paper form, circle the respective score; on the online version, select the score from the dropdown list] 
optionally, assign a trend-adjustment for each score: +1 for improving, 0 for stable, or -1 for worsening [on the paper form, write the respective trend-adjustment; on the online version, select the trend-value from the dropdown list] 
move to a related tetradian domain (i.e. to one of the three link-themes if a dimension, to one of the two linked dimensions if a link-theme, or to overall integration etc) 
Repeat this sequence until all domains and the overall integration have been assessed.  
See SEMPER-11 assessment (p.121) for a set of example forms that can be used for SEMPER-11 assessments. 
Aspirational dimension – identity and purpose 
semper_s
The core business issue here is that identity and purpose are essential to define ‘effective’ within the context. 
Aspirational or spiritual assets include anything which supports the definition of identity and purpose, and the relationship of Self to Self (whatever Self may be in the context). In tangible form, this includes corporate identity; logos and branding; vision, mission and values statements (see Vision and Values); strategy documents (see Sensemaking and foresight) and policies on acceptable and unacceptable behaviours (see Responsibility and empowerment). Intangible assets include morale, commitment and overall ‘health and fitness’ of the enterprise. 
Questions 
Who is ‘We’, or ‘Us’? – For an individual, use “Who is ‘I’?”, and change ‘We’ or ‘Us’ to ‘I’ in subsequent questions. 
How is ‘We’ defined? What are the boundaries between ‘Us’ and ‘not-Us’? – Look also for boundaries between members  /  ‘insiders’ and non-members  /  ‘outsiders’. 
How are these boundaries between ‘Us’ and ‘not-Us’ maintained? How is the integrity of ‘Us’ maintained? – This includes both internal integrity (morale, health etc) and external (self-protection, etc). 
What do ‘We’ stand for? What is the purpose for ‘Us’ in existing? – In a commercial context, emphasise the need to move beyond “making money” as a purpose; financial 
performance is not a viable purpose in itself, but an outcome of a wider overall purpose. 
How are aspirational assets such as morale measured and maintained? – Note any mistaken tendency to treat aspirational / spiritual properties as physical – for example, acting as if morale can be bought, sold or transferred to others.

Relational dimension – internal and external relationships 

The key business issue here is that performance and profitability are tightly correlated with quality of relationships, whether internal (staff, employees), intermediate (business partners, consultants, shareholders) or external (customers, suppliers, other stakeholders). 
Relational or emotional assets include anything which defines and supports relationships between Self and Other. (In a collective, the 
‘Other’ may be internal, intermediate or external, as above.) In a tangible form, these may represented by images such as brands; by documents such as contracts, or exchanges of telephone calls and emails; customer and employment records; or simply by physical presence. However, the assets themselves are invariably intangible, as they indicate trust between entities rather than as an attribute of some specific entity. Relational assets may also be either two-way and mutual, or one-way from or towards the Self (as in reputation or commitment to a brand). All relational assets are volatile over time, and will usually need regular maintenance. 
Questions 
What relationships with others are needed in order to support the purpose? – Include and distinguish between internal, intermediate and external relationships. 
What form do these relationships take? – Identify content (e.g. documents, records, web-server logs) that indicates existence and status of each asset. 
In what ways are relationships structured? – Include formal structures (e.g. hierarchies, contracts) and informal networks (e.g. communities of practice). 
How are relational assets measured and maintained? – Include one-way relationships towards Self but outside the control of the Self, such as reputation; note also any tendency to treat relational / emotional properties as physical – for example, where “Our people are our greatest asset!” is mistaken for an asset to buy from or sell to others. 
In what ways are shared successes acknowledged and celebrated? – Identify especially celebrations of ‘heroes’ who exemplify the organisation’s values and purpose

Conceptual dimension – knowledge and mindset 

Knowledge is a key differentiator for competitive advantage. Beliefs and world-views also underpin what is perceived as possible and not-possible. 
Conceptual assets include anything which expresses some form of knowledge, or supports knowledge, belief and other relationships between Self and idea. In tangible form (explicit knowledge), this includes patents, trademarks and other intellectual property; libraries, databases and documents; and also financial records and other forms of organisational history. As history, knowledge tends to represent the past, but may need to focus on the future (see Sense-making and foresight) or the immediate present (see Active learning). Most conceptual assets are intangible (tacit knowledge), usually reside only within or between people (see Narrative and dialogue) and may well be inexpressible in  explicit form. 
Questions 
What records, information, knowledge and beliefs are needed to support the purpose? – Include and distinguish between each type of asset, and between explicit and tacit forms of these; also include assets needed for creativity and innovation, for organisational history and for external compliance. 
To what extent are these assets available for the organisation? How are these assets identified, created, maintained, distributed and shared? – Include support both for explicit assets – e.g. databases, ‘best practice’ – and tacit assets (see next question). 
What support is provided for the social processes of knowledge? – Include social-networks, communities-of-practice and other human-centred forms of knowledge management. 
What processes exist to determine what knowledge to share, and with whom? – Cross-links to organisational purpose are crucial here, especially in complex value-web relationships. 
To what extent does the business-model depend on withholding access to knowledge? – Business-models that depend on withholding of conceptual assets – for security reasons, to increase sale-value, etc – are inherently fragile because of the tendency of all knowledge to migrate to the public domain.

Behavioural dimension – actions, resources and environment 

The key business issue here is efficiency and optimisation of business practice. 
Behavioural and physical assets include anything which supports execution and tangible business activity, such as physical resources, facilities and equipment; environment and workspace; competencies and skill-sets; processes, workflows and transactions; and physical energy and infrastructure needed to support the tasks – electricity, gas, transport, data-cabling, etc. This would also include financial resources, as part of the means to obtain those more tangible resources. 
Most of these assets are directly tangible, and all are measurable in quantitative terms. However, precisely because they are tangible and measurable, there is often an over-emphasis on these assets, to the detriment of overall integration. This may also be seen as an over-emphasis on local efficiency or cost-control at the expense of overall effectiveness. 
Questions 
What resources, skill-sets and other physical assets are needed to support the purpose? – Include and distinguish between each type of asset, and the tasks for which each is required. 
How are these assets identified, obtained, maintained, distributed and shared? – Note especially the assets and transactions in multi-party supply-chains and value-webs 
To what extent are these assets available to the organisation as needed? – Assess redundancy and backup, storage needs, just-in-time resource management etc for workflows 
What physical facilities and environment are needed to support each task? – Include and assess issues such as health and safety, workflow traffic, personal  /  shared space, morale etc 
How are these environmental resources identified, obtained, maintained, and shared? – Note especially the extent to which individuals are involved in creating their own workspace and workflow 
What processes are used to optimise transactions, workflows and environment? – Effectiveness depends on continuous reassessment of efficiency, especially in fast-changing contexts’

Vision and values 

An enterprise is essentially a collection of relationships brought together for a common purpose. Vision and values provide the bonds that hold these relationships together, and underpin both the enterprise’s internal culture and its relations with its inter-mediate and external stakeholders. 
Distinctions need to be drawn between vision, purpose, missions and goals. Vision must be ‘larger’ than the enterprise, as it pro-vides an anchor for relationships with stakeholders; purpose is how the enterprise sees itself in relation to that ‘world picture’ (see Aspirations – identity and purpose), whilst missions and goals define short-term strategies and tactics (see Sense-making and foresight). 
Questions 
How do aspirations support relationships, and vice versa? – Vision and values should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
In what ways are vision and values defined? – Note any formal statements of vision and values, but also assess implicit values in the culture 
What distinctions are drawn between vision, purpose, mission, goal? – Failure to distinguish appropriately between these is a common cause of ineffectiveness 
What differences exist between what the organisation says, and what it does? – Assess differences between espoused and actual values, vision, etc 
What processes are used to review and revise vision and values? – Assess also who is and is not included in such processes 
In what contexts are overall vision and values reassessed and revised? – Common examples include merger / acquisition, regular whole-of-organisation meetings, etc 
In what ways do vision and values support commitment and ‘ownership’? – Assess the impact of vision and values on everyday decision-making and work-practice 
In what ways do vision and values reflect work / life balance and other ‘external’ themes? – Assess the extent to which the ‘whole person’ and the wider community are acknowledged at work

Skills and leadership 

Leadership may take a variety of different forms: for example, coach-ing and mentoring, to assist others to develop their skills (see Active learn-ing) and responsibilities (see Em-powerment and responsibility); ‘holding the vision’ for a group or team (see Vision and values); innovation and development of strategy and tactics (see Sense-making and foresight); or creating inspirational stories (see Narrative and dialogue). 
However, in this context, leadership is primarily the means through which relationships are expressed in action, leading Self and others through successive stages of a workflow or overall task. One variant of this is the usual managerial role, with its emphasis on the immediate issues of productivity and process, but different styles of leadership are needed in each stage of the classic Group Dynamics cycle of Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and Adjourning. 
Questions 
How do relationships support actions, environment and resources, and vice versa? – Leadership should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
In what ways do structured relationships support leadership? – Assess and compare formal structures (e.g. hierarchy) and informal structures (e.g. communities of practice) 
In what ways is everyone a leader, and everyone recognised as a leader? – Also assess who is identified as ‘leaders’, by whom, whether formally or informally, and in what contexts 
In what ways do leadership roles and styles vary according to context? – Assess context-dependent changes both of role and of structure (e.g. hierarchy vs self-organising team)  
What impact do leadership styles have upon productivity and performance? – Also  assess measurements – if any – used for evaluation and review 
What processes exist to develop leadership? – Compare formal (e.g. training) and informal (e.g. coaching, mentoring) leadership development; also assess tools and techniques used to support this (e.g. psychological profiling, 360º feedback)

Active learning 

Learning through reflection and feedback is the primary means through which efficien-cies are created, product, skill and service quality improved, and safety enhanced. 
Some form of self-reflection, either on an individual or a group level – such as in TQM, quality circles and after-action reviews – is usually the most effective approach, although this tends to be a domain of incremental improvement rather than quantum transformation. For the latter, some form of external analysis will usually be needed, as in business process reengineering and classic ‘scientific management’ – though care needs to be taken to ensure that new processes are co-created (see Leadership) rather than imposed through ‘edicts from above’, in case inadvertent damage to Responsibility and empowerment counters any potential gains in productivity. 
Questions 
How does knowledge support actions, environment and resources, and vice versa? – Active learning should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
What processes exist to support team learning? – Assess support for improvement as a collective rather than solely as individuals (e.g. system improvement) 
What processes exist to provide feedback for individual or collective improvement? – Assess availability and quality of feedback from supervisors, co-workers, and the overall work-context 
In what ways is improvement externally defined? In what ways is it co-created? – Assess roles and relationships of external ‘others’ such as facilitators and analysts in process improvement; assess also the extent to which local knowledge and experience is used and applied in innovation 
In what ways is learning grounded in practice? – Identify support for ‘thinking with the hands’ as well as ‘thinking with head’ 
What facilities and processes exist to support skills development in ‘safe space’? – Assess options such as simulation, role-play and ‘sandbox’ practice-grounds 
What is the balance between intermittent and continuous skills development? – Compare event-based processes such as workshops or lectures with continuous learning-in-action 
What theoretical models are used to assess options for improvement? – Examples include workflow mapping, time and motion study, action research and after-action review

Narrative and dialogue 

Personal stories provide not only a history of transactions and relationships, but also a core source of organisational knowledge. It’s also true that “markets are convers-ations” – and those relationships in turn, especially in the longer term, depend on the openness and honesty of the co-created stories. 
Stories are often layered, creating knowledge linking best-practice or worst-practice with the culture’s deep myths and beliefs. By definition, tacit knowledge is personal – “people know more than they can say, and can say more than they can write down” – and often created with others in an emergent process developing over time; hence interpersonal relations and people-management issues are often also crucial to an organisation’s management of its collective knowledge. 
Questions 
How do relationships support knowledge, and vice versa? – Narrative and dialogue should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
What facilities exist to manage, maintain and share tacit knowledge? – Examples include communities of practice, weblogs, social network applications, expertise directories 
What processes exist to create and elicit shared knowledge? – Examples include Bohm dialogue, large-group intervention (e.g. Open Space), narrative enquiry 
In what ways are ‘outsiders’ engaged in the organisation’s stories and history? – Assess themes such as marketing, stakeholder engagement, public relations and reputation management 
How are the boundaries between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ managed in creating knowledge? – Assess themes such as partnering, value webs, co-design, demand innovation and viral marketing 
What processes exist to identify and manage ‘anti-stories’? – Assess the impact and validity of alternate views and sub-cultures, counter-myths and ‘shadow networks’

Sense-making and foresight 

The key concern here is to create a balance between the aspirations for the future and the knowledge of the past. The end-result of these processes is strategy and tactics. 
Unlike Vision and values, which are anchored in feelings, strategy is anchored in knowledge. Selection of tools and techniques depends greatly on the context. Traditional ‘top-down’ strategic planning still works well in stable, low-change environments; but most enterprises will need the greater versatility and adaptability of emergent techniques derived from complexity science, which in turn depend on a broader diversity of views and experience to create bridges between over-specialised ‘silos’. 
Questions 
How do identity and purpose support knowledge, and vice versa? – Sense-making and foresight should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
Who is involved in development of strategy? – Assess the scope of engagement (e.g. top management only, managers, other staff, suppliers, etc.) 
What processes are used to gather and collate knowledge for strategy? – Examples include business intelligence, focus groups, large-group interventions (e.g. Future Search) 
In what ways does the strategy acknowledge and allow for emergence and uncertainty? – Assess the resilience of strategy, the extent to which it can self-adapt proactively to changing contexts 
What processes are used to make sense of inherent uncertainty? – Examples include scenario development, Cynefin sense-making, causal layered analysis, Bohm dialogue 
What processes are used to identify needed skills, resources, relationships, knowledge? – Assess especially the roles of generalists in bridging specialist ‘silos’ 
What processes are used to partition strategy into detailed actions? – Assess the breakdown of strategy into vision, purpose, missions and goals for each actor in the strategy 
What processes are used to ensure alignment with and commitment to the strategy? – Assess and compare ‘top-down’ command-and-control with consensus and engagement 
In what ways do the culture’s beliefs, deep myths and stories affect strategy? – Assess also the impact on strategy implementation of differences between espoused and actual values

Responsibility and empowerment 

The key issue here is personal power – ‘the ability to do work’ in appropriate ways, with choice, responsibility and purpose. 
Empowerment and responsibility are supported and developed through Active learning and Leadership, but their roots are in purpose and practice. Ultimately, ‘the ability to do work’ arises only from within the Self, but support is usually needed to bring it out. Power-transactions between individuals are always either power-with (mutual support or ‘win / win’) or power-against (mutual destruction or ‘lose / lose’). Productivity depends on support for power-with; power-against becomes prevalent, in forms such as bullying, back-biting and ‘office politics’, whenever the link to shared purpose is lost and power is seen only as ‘external’ to Self (the ‘win / lose’ delusion).  
Questions 
How do actions, resources, environment support identity and purpose, and vice versa? – Responsibility, empowerment should provide a bridge for mutual support and optimisation of these assets 
What beliefs are held about the source of personal power and collective power? – Contrast views of source as external (power is ‘given’ or ‘taken’) or internal (personal responsibility) 
To what extent is the workspace managed through mutual respect? – Other useful keywords to identify ‘power-with’ include empowerment, compassion, love and humility 
To what extent is the workspace managed through fear? – Other useful keywords to identify ‘power-against’ include domination, manipulation and blame 
To what extent is self-denigration or self-doubt an issue here? – Identify any tendency towards ‘lose / win’ as well as ‘win / lose’ 
What practices exist to support development of personal power and responsibility? – Examples include meditation, martial arts, sports training, coaching and mentoring 
What practices exist to support development of collective power and responsibility? – Examples include large-group interventions such as Open Space, World Café and group dialogue 
What processes exist to link practice to purpose? – Purpose also provides links to vision and values, and to foresight and strategy

Integration - bringing it all together 
semper_i
‘Think global, act local’ applies as much to busi-ness integration as to anything else: whenever we plan and execute any intervention in any part of the organisation, we need to be aware of its effects on the whole. 
Two key requirements for integration are an appropriate framework, usually based on principles from complexity-science; and strong support for the generalists who create bridges between departments and specialities, and between ideas, skills, resources, relationships and alternate views of purpose. Overall effectiveness can rarely be achieved without these, as they provide the anchors for ‘efficiency on purpose’. 
Questions 
What models and frameworks are used to create and maintain integration? – Examples include Beer viable-systems model, Tetradian SEMPER, Sengé five disciplines 
What whole-of-system support exists for integration? – Assess mechanisms, if any, which support feedback and reflection between all parts of the organisation 
In what ways does the organisation identify and support its generalists? – Assess especially the absence of such support, such as performance against inappropriate metrics 
What is the balance between formal and informal structures in the organisation? – Formal structures provides anchors for organisation, but most work is done through informal structures 
How is overall effectiveness monitored and managed? – Assess usage, if any, of multi-axis metrics such as Balanced Scorecard

Assessing relevance 
The R5 keywords – recursion, rotation, reflexion, reciprocation, resonance – provide a focus through which to assess the relevance of the selected issue in relation to the whole. The five principles are derived from systems theory and complexity science, to extend and enhance the 

classic models of ‘scientific management’. The following assess-ment questions combine various aspects of these principles. 
Questions 
What is this an example of? – Assess ways in which the same issues repeat on a larger scale 
What is an example of this? – Assess ways in which the same issues repeat on a smaller scale 
How could this be simplified by learning from other examples of this? – Assess options to create consistency or remove special cases through ‘self-similarity’ with related issues 
What is another perspective on this? – Rotate to a different view (e.g. from another department, customer, supplier, another culture or time) 
What is not being acknowledged and addressed in this? – Assess the ‘undiscussables’, especially issues and events projected or reflected onto others 
What aspects of the whole can be seen in this? – Assess ways in which themes of the whole organisation are reflected and exemplified in this issue 
What is being exchanged, created, destroyed or transformed in this? – Assess overall changes to types of assets or resources (e.g. morale created, relationships destroyed); also assess what types and quantities of assets and resources are exchanged, and by what or whom 
Are all physical exchanges and transformations balanced in this? – Assess system ‘leakages’ such as inefficiency, waste, pollution etc [Note: balance or imbalance may only occur over a whole system, or over time] 
How is physical balance maintained and assured in this? – Assess measures to identify, monitor and address any imbalance 
Who ‘wins’ from transactions in this? How, and in what ways? – Assess balance and reciprocity in non-physical and other non-zero-sum transactions (e.g. money, prestige) 
How is ‘win-win’ created and assured within transactions in this? – In non- zero-sum transactions, compare tendencies towards ‘win-win’ versus ‘win-lose’ (illusory ‘lose-lose’) 
What are the responsibilities in this? – Assess who is responsible for what, and how those responsibilities are identified, monitored and assured 
How are the responsibilities balanced in this? – Assess mutuality of responsibilities, especially any arbitrary assignment of ‘rights’ (i.e. non-responsibilities)

APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY  
This glossary describes specific meanings of terms used in SEMPER. Cross-references between terms are shown in italic text. 

active learning 
 systematic process of reflection on action, to develop skills and competencies; examples include action-learning / action-research, Quality Circles, debriefing and task self-assessment; link-theme between mental dimension and physical dimension 
 

appropriate 
 matching the intended overall purpose; a REAL  /  LEARN effectiveness-assessment theme associated with the spiritual dimension of the context 
 

aspirational dimension 
 see spiritual dimension 
 

behavioural dimension 
 see physical dimension 
 

business-as-usual 
 shorthand term for a common paradigm of business and business-management characterised by a command-and-control model, win / lose transactions, short-term thinking, narrow focus, an over-emphasis on efficiency at the expense of overall effectiveness, and lack of awareness of the performance paradox 
 

chaos 
 domain of inherent uncertainty and unpredictability; in the business context, may be partially concealed in demographics and other aggregates, but at the individual level all real-world transactions involve some chaos and complexity; also useful when invoked intentionally in creativity, in narrative and dialogue, and in foresight techniques such as scenario construction 
 

complexity 
 domain of emergent properties and non-linear relationships between factors; unlike chaos, which is inherently uncertain, may often create an illusion of predictability, especially where linear analysis is applied within a short-term, narrow set of assumptions 
 

conceptual dimension 
 see mental dimension 
 

dialogue 
 process of emergent conversation in which awareness and knowledge are created between the people involved; link-theme between mental dimension and emotional dimension 
 

effective 
 ‘on purpose’, producing the intended overall result with an optimised balance over the whole context; requires broad generalist awareness of the whole, rather than the narrow focus required to create local efficiency, hence often contrasted with efficient 
 

efficient 
 ‘doing more with less’, creating the maximum result with the minimum use or waste of resources in a specific activity or context; improved incrementally through active learning and related techniques; major improvements usually require a change in paradigm; a REAL  /  LEARN effectiveness-assessment theme associated with the mental dimension of the context 
 

elegant 
 human dimensions of effectiveness, such as feelings, emotions and ergonomics, expressed in issues such as usability, simplicity and personal preference; a REAL  /  LEARN effectiveness-assessment theme associated with the emotional dimension of the context 
 

emergence 
 context within which cause-effect patterns can be identified only retrospectively, and in which analytic techniques are usually unreliable and misleading 
 

emotional dimension 
 relational and emotional aspects of the work context: feelings and values, internal relationships and interpersonal transactions, relationships with external stakeholders; also assets such as reputation and trust; see also vision, value; leadership; narrative, dialogue 
 

empowerment 
 the process and practice of deriving power from within the self, or assisting others through power-with; link-theme between spiritual dimension and physical dimension 
 

foresight 
 the discipline of developing a forward view in time; link-theme between spiritual dimension and mental dimension; see also sense-making; strategy, scenario 
 

goal 
 a specific objective to be achieved by or before a specified point in time; contrasted with mission, purpose and vision 
 

integration 
 contextual awareness of all the interactions between the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions of work and the workspace, and the active process of linking them together into a unified whole 
 

leadership 
 mentoring, coaching, example and other processes for guidance of Self and Other in action; link-theme between physical dimension and emotional dimension 
 

lose / win 
 dysfunctional power-transaction (power-against) in which one attempts to help the Other win by making Self lose 
 

mental dimension 
 mental and conceptual aspects of work and the workspace: beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, procedures and process specifications; also knowledge-assets and intellectual capital 
 

mental model 
 chosen set of beliefs and method to interpret a given context; usually underpinned by a less-conscious paradigm or worldview 
 

mission 
 a desired state to be achieved, usually within a specified timeframe, and to be maintained indefinitely thereafter; contrasted with goal, purpose and vision 
 

narrative 
 personalised and often emotive expression or interpretation of knowledge, as history, anecdote or story; link-theme between mental dimension and emotional dimension 
 

optimisation 
 process of integration in which efficiency in different areas is traded-off and balanced for maximum effectiveness over the whole; in any complex or layered context, the process relies extensively on the REAL  /  LEARN themes (efficient, reliable, elegant, appropriate, integrated) to identify the energies and resources to be balanced, and on the R5 principles (recursion, rotation, reflexion, reciprocation, resonance) to identify balances and trade-offs between layers and sub-contexts such as departments, business processes and business units 
 

paradigm 
 coherent set of beliefs about cause-effect relationships within a given class of context 
 

performance paradox 
 an effectiveness paradox in which a desired result is achieved by paying attention to everything except the desired result; arises where that result depends on emergent properties derived from the optimisation of many factors in complex non-linear relationships – for example, a business-as-usual over-focus on financial results produces weaker financial performance than a focus on integration issues such as customer service and employee satisfaction 
 

physical dimension 
 physical aspects of work and the workspace: skills, competencies, physical processes, behaviours, actions; also tangible assets and work-environment 
 

power 
 the ability to do work; in human terms, includes the ability to work, play, relate, learn, as an expression of personal choice, responsibility and purpose, and with awareness and respect of shared purpose; exists only within the Self; see also power-with, power-against 
 

power-against 
 collective win / lose or lose / win process in which power is mistakenly believed to be transferred between Self and Other; contrasted with power-with 
 

power-with 
 collective win / win process to assist Self and / or Other to access personal power; contrasted with power-against 
 

principle 
 a conceptual commitment or model, the mental-dimension equivalent of value 
 

purpose 
 a declared role within the ‘world’ described by a vision; contrasted with goal, mission and vision 
 

R5 
 collective term for five complexity-science principles used with the tetradian, namely recursion, rotation, reflexion, reciprocation and resonance. 
 

REAL  /  LEARN 
 acronym for four keywords to evaluate effectiveness: reliable, efficient, appropriate, elegant; the LEARN acronym includes integration in the evaluation-set 
 

reciprocation 
 overall balance in transactions, especially power-transactions; reciprocal balance between entities may not be direct or immediate, and in many cases balance may only be achieved over time at a system-wide level, with energy-transfers occurring between physical, mental, emotional and / or spiritual dimensions; an R5 principle for assessment of effectiveness and relevance 
 

recursion 
 patterns of relationship or interaction repeat or are ‘self-similar’ at different scales; permits simplification of otherwise complex processes; an R5 principle for assessment of effectiveness and relevance 
 

reflexion 
 corollary of recursion, in that the whole, or aspects of the whole, can be identified within the attributes and transactions of any part at any scale; an R5 principle for assessment of effectiveness and relevance 
 

relational dimension 
 see emotional dimension 
 

reliable 
 high degree of certainty and predictability for a desired outcome; a REAL  /  LEARN effectiveness-assessment theme associated with the physical dimension of the context 
 

resonance 
 impacts of positive- or negative-feedback (increasing or damping) in a system; permits simplification of otherwise complex processes; an R5 principle for assessment of effectiveness and relevance 
 

responsibility 
 literally ‘response-ability’, the ability to choose and act upon appropriate responses according to context, as an expression of personal power; link-theme between spiritual dimension and physical dimension 
 

rotation 
 systematic process of assessing a context from multiple perspectives; an R5 principle for assessment of effectiveness and relevance 
 

scenario 
 an imagined future context, developed for the purpose of understanding both the present context and options for action in the future context; a foresight technique 
 

self-propagation 
 aspect of integration in which a meme – an idea, a practice, a way of relating – spreads throughout an enterprise, requiring little or no effort or intervention beyond the initial ‘seeding’; contrasted with the more typical ‘command-and-control’ tactics of business-as-usual, which require constant effort and intervention to impose a meme throughout the enterprise 
 

SEMPER 
 acronym for Spiritual, Emotional, Mental, Physical, Effectiveness (REAL  /  LEARN), Relevance (R5); alternatively, acronym for ‘System Effectiveness Map for Process Evaluation and Review’; also the Latin word for ‘always’ 
 

sense-making 
 the process of creating mental models to provide a conceptual framework for understanding ambiguity, emergence and uncertainty; link-theme between spiritual dimension and mental dimension; see also foresight 
 

spiritual dimension 
 aspirational and intentional aspects of work and the workplace, expressed in collective and individual identity and purpose, and in issues such as ethics, values and codes of conduct; also commitment-assets and spiritual capital such as organisational morale, health and fitness; see also vision, value; sense-making, foresight; empowerment, responsibility 
 

‘start anywhere’ principle 
 corollary of self-propagation, in that ‘seeding’ for integration may start from any aspect of the enterprise – usually away from nominal ‘problems’ – allowing emergence to indicate ‘winners’ for further propagation; contrasts with conventional interventions which attempt to tackle ‘problem’-issues head-on, often further inflaming the problem, or transferring the problem elsewhere within the organisation 
 

strategy 
 ‘big picture’ view of a plan of action, usually incorporating vision, mission and goal; contrasted with tactics required to execute the plan 
 

tactics 
 detailed step-by-step activities to execute a strategy, or some segment of an overall strategy 
 

tetradian (alt. tetradion) 
 depiction of the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions as four axes in a tetrahedral relationship, usually also showing the respective link-themes as the edges between the vertices of the tetrahedron 
 

value 
 an emotional commitment; link-theme between spiritual dimension and emotional dimension 
 

vision 
 description of a desired ‘world’, always far greater than any individual or organisation; described in the present tense, yet is never ‘achieved’; contrasted with goal, mission and purpose; link-theme between spiritual dimension and emotional dimension 
 

win / lose 
 dysfunctional power-transaction (power-against) in which one Self attempts to win by forcing the Other to lose 
 

win / win 
 functional power-transaction in which both Self and Other achieve part or all of their objectives for the transaction; contrasted with the dysfunctional ‘lose / lose’ transactions win / lose and lose / win 
 

worldview 
 largely unconscious but generally coherent set of beliefs about how the world operates; at the level of day-to-day practice, approximately synonymous with paradigm
