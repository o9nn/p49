# Pattern Dynamics™ Image Collection

This folder contains 30+ images illustrating the Pattern Dynamics framework, a sophisticated systems thinking methodology that exhibits profound resonance with Integral Semiotic Realism.

## Comprehensive Analysis

For a detailed analysis of these images through the Integral Semiotic Realism framework, see:

**[../PATTERN-ANALYSIS.md](../PATTERN-ANALYSIS.md)**

This document provides:
- Triadic mapping of Pattern Dynamics concepts to ISR categories
- Analysis of the six evolutionary cycles (0-6)
- Interpretation of the infinity loop structure
- Integration with viable systems, learning loops, and temporal patterns
- Scheme and TypeScript implementations of discovered patterns

## Key Images Overview

## Integration with ISR Framework

The Pattern Dynamics images reveal **independent discovery of the same fundamental truth**: reality is structured as a **triadic semiotic process**. Key convergences:

| Pattern Dynamics | Integral Semiotic Realism |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Infinity Loop | Continuous Signification |
| Six Cycles | Pattern Evolution / Cosmic Habit Formation |
| Three Planes | Three Domains (Actual, Intransitive, Empirical) |
| Viable System Triad | Nested Semiotic Cycles |
| Sense Source | NonDual Origin |
| Meta-morphosis | Nondual Evolution |

## Usage

These images serve as:
1. **Theoretical foundation** for the Pattern Dynamics framework
2. **Visual validation** of triadic semiotic structure across domains
3. **Practical templates** for organizational and systems design
4. **Educational resources** for understanding complex adaptive systems
