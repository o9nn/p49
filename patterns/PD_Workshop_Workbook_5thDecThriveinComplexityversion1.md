    Introduction   PatternDynamics™ resolves complexity
                   The challenge of our age is to facilitate global sustainability through the crea-
                   tion of a truly thriving planetary civilization.

                   The key to this challenge is our capacity to deal with complexity. We have
                   created an increasingly large, fast paced and complex world, but our ability
                   to coordinate ourselves has not kept pace.

                   PatternDynamics™ is a simple tool that can be learned by anyone to
                   overcome the challenges posed by complex systems – at any scale.

### Here’s how it works:

                   s   4HE KEY TO COMPLEXITY IS systems thinking
                   s   4HE KEY TO SYSTEMS THINKING IS Patterns; and
                   s   4HE KEY TO USING 0ATTERNS IS TO FORM THEM INTO A language.

                   PatternDynamics™ is a language of visual Patterns – a ‘Sustainability Pattern
                   Language’– that will help you understand, communicate and design solutions
                   at the systems level. By learning PatternDynamics™ you will gain
                   a powerful new capacity as a ‘systems thinker’– a skill that is often thought to
                   be unteachable.

                   With this skill you will learn to create Cultures of Sustainability and to facilitate
                   Deep Sustainability Design: sustainability strategies that help resolve complex
                   challenges at any level of organisation, from the community to the planetary,
                   and in any domain, from business to governance to institutional.

         Theory    PatternDynamics™ is based on 3 simple ideas

### 1. Sustainable Natural Patterns:

                   Complex natural systems exhibit consistent general patterns of organisation
                   that have allowed them to persist and thrive for many hundreds of millions
                   of years. These ‘patterns of organisation’ provide us with design templates
                   that illustrate how complex dynamics systems work. Natural patterns are like
                   ‘keys’ that help us unlock the mysteries of working with whole systems. As such,
                   they provide us with principles we can rely on to guide us in the creation and
                   design of sustainable futures.

### 2. The Power of Language:

                   Language – the system of symbols we use to communicate – has a powerful
                   role in shaping what we actually see. In each historical age people have
                   developed symbols that help them to see, communicate about, and act on
                   the things that are important for their collective survival and prosperity. What
                   has become clear with regard to complex sustainability challenges is that we
                   do not have effective languages for seeing the ‘whole system’.

### 3. A Sustainability Pattern Language:

                   Our current spoken, written and mathematical languages are excellent for
                   analyzing the nature of ‘parts’, but they are not optimized for helping us see
                   how these parts are connected and organized as ‘wholes’. By combining the
                   patterns of nature with the power of language, PatternDynamics™ creates a
                   Sustainability Pattern Language – a language of wholistic symbols designed
                   to help us develop the systems thinking capacity needed to meet the
                   complex challenges of creating a sustainable planetary civilization.
Philosophy   Local structures create planetary culture
             Our basic philosophy is that the biggest lever in human affairs is
             culture – the understandings, beliefs, values and their expression that provide
             the shared meaning that glues us together in social systems.

             Culture is an invisible field of shared consciousness that shapes our behaviours
             and dictates the acceptance or rejection of social changes. This is what
             organisational change expert Peter Drucker means when he states: “culture
             eats strategy for breakfast.”

             PatternDynamics™ creates ‘Cultures of Sustainability‘, cultures that value systems
             thinking and build the capacity to resolve complex organisational challenges.

             Our approach to creating cultures of sustainability is to focus on the
             organisational level – what we call ‘local structures’. Local structures provide
             human scale environments to develop complex problem solving skills.

             We believe that learning to thrive by resolving complex challenges inside local
             structures requires the same culture, competencies and capacities needed
             to create sustainability outside the organisation, where it must play a role in
             global sustainability – what we refer to as creating ‘planetary culture’.

    About    PatternDynamics™: a planetary social enterprise
             Our vision is to provide a real and practical tool for creating the consciousness
             required to form a planetary civilization and a truly sustainable, thriving global
             society.

             As an enterprise, our defining identity and purpose is to do this by providing a
             social benefit through the dissemination of PatternDynamics™ (PD), an Integral
             Sustainability Pattern Language. PD is a way of learning the principles of
             sustainability through the patterns of nature in order to communicate about
             ‘whole systems’ and to facilitate the sustainability of complex organisations at
             all scales.

             We think of PD as a language of human evolution.

             As a Pattern Language, PatternDynamics™ is a technology in the form
             of Intellectual Property. The Intellectual Property consists of a set of visual
             Patterns, their Charts, descriptions and usage instructions.

             As a social enterprise PatternDynamics™ is foremost a Community of
             Practice – a community of PD practitioners derived from a wide range of
             people, invited from all domains and levels of society, who are committed to
             facilitating the transition to a sustainable world.

      Definition   The temporal aspects of systems.

     Description   The Rhythm Pattern represents the repetitions, swings, pulses and
                   synchronizations that align the elements and activities of a system through
                   time. Rhythms provide a regularity that allows elements of a system to
                   coordinate with each other. Rhythms must possess a reliable regularity, but
                   they must also change and adapt to evolving circumstances. The role of
                   Rhythm is to coordinate events in time.

       Principle   The principle of good timing: the enduring health of any system depends
                   on the appropriate balance and integration of the temporal capacity for
                   both regularity and variation, for a given context.

    Composition    The Rhythm Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
                   organising pattern of all systems.

      Examples     Organism: All life forms have rhythms of activity that vary in order to
        Nature     support the health of that organism. Respiration in animals is a good
                   example of a rhythmic activity that serves to coordinate the activity of
                   the entire organism in order to keep it healthy. If the rhythm of respiration
                   is too slow the animal will not have enough oxygen to drive metabolic
                   processes, but if it is too fast it may cause hyperventilation – the loss of too
                   much carbon dioxide from the blood and resultant loss of blood pressure.

                   Ecosystem: Humans have intervened in natural forest fire cycles by
                   introducing smaller, but more frequent fires. This keeps the fuel load from
                   building up to the point where there are large, hot fires that may destroy
                   property. Changing the Rhythm of fire frequency has other wider effects
                   on the ecosystem, including changing species composition of both
                   plants and animals, altering soil conditions and changing predator/prey
                   relationships.

        Culture    Organisation: Businesses have financial reporting cycles that influence
                   rhythms within the business like capital expenditures, investment strategies
                   and wage level adjustments. In most cases annual reporting is sufficient,
                   but if a business is undergoing a period of rapid growth or change it may
                   be necessary to do more frequent financial analysis in order to keep the
                   business healthy.

                   Economy: All scales of economies throughout history have displayed
                   extremities and irregularities in their levels of activity which has posed
                   challenges for the sustainability of those economies. This is referred to as a
                   ‘boom and bust’ dynamic. Governments and financial institutions regularly
                   intervene to try to moderate extreme swings in financial activities and to
                   introduce more reliability into the rhythms of financial markets.

               PatternDynamics™.

  Definition   The interplay of opposites within a system.

 Description   The Polarity Pattern represents opposing forces as two ends of a continuum
               in dynamic interplay. The relationship between polarities stores potential
               and their integration liberates energies that drive the activity of systems.
               Polarities must be integrated to take advantage of both approaches, but
               they must also be maintained to build potential. The role of Polarity is to
               maintain the potential within systems.

   Principle   The principle of paradox: the enduring health of any system depends on
               the appropriate balance and integration of the interplay of opposing
               dynamics, for a given context.

Composition    The Polarity Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
               organising pattern of all systems.

  Examples     Organism: All organisms must balance the relationship between inputs to
    Nature     their system and the outputs from their system. If an organism is growing
               then its inputs of nutrients need to exceed its output of wastes. If conditions
               change in the environment and nutrients for that organism become
               scarce it must then adjust so that outputs exceed inputs, allowing it to
               shrink and survive.

               Ecosystem: The interplay between periods of orderly growth and the
               chaotic bush fires in northern boreal forests is a major planetary regulator
               of oxygen levels, and by extension the maintenance of atmospheric
               conditions favorable to life. If the forests do not burn when oxygen levels
               become high then less fire adapted ecosystems will ignite. If boreal forests
               were to continue to burn when oxygen levels are low some organisms
               would struggle to respire.

    Culture    Organisation: The interplay between the more feminine capacity for
               connection and relationship and the more masculine capacity for individual
               achievement provides a potential within an organisation for outcomes
               not able to be attained by either polarity alone. A relational approach is
               necessary for good communications and good decision making, but a
               capacity for achievement is necessary to enact the decisions made through
               those good communications.

               Economy: The economy is potentized by the dynamic relationship
               between cooperation within enterprises and competition with outside
               rivals. Competition leads to productivity and efficiency gains, but unless it is
               integrated with cooperation it becomes a negative force creating hyper-
               individualism which causes social disintegration. Cooperation creates
               synergies, but unless it is integrated with competition it leads to a loss of drive
               by high performing individuals necessary for a strong economy.

                    that are encompassed by the larger oval into a ‘whole’ system.

                    The Structure Pattern is closely related to and serves as an aspect of
                    the Source Pattern, the most foundational organising principle within
                    PatternDynamics™.

       Definition   The enduring frameworks of systems.

      Description   The Structure Pattern represents the solid, relatively unchanging,
                    frameworks, scaffolding or ‘bones’ of a system. Structural frameworks must
                    be the most solid and enduring aspects of a system, but they must also
                    have some capacity for flexibility. The role of Structure is to support the
                    more active and changeable aspects of systems.

        Principle   The principle of effective frameworks: the enduring health of any system
                    depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the structural
                    capacities for both rigidity and flexibility, for a given context.

     Composition    The Structure Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
                    organising pattern of all systems.

       Examples     Organism: All higher animals have interior structural frameworks called
         Nature     a skeleton who’s job is to provide support for the rest of the body. If the
                    bones of a creature’s skeleton become too brittle and lose their flexibility,
                    they may break. If bones are too flexible and soft they cannot support the
                    weight of the other elements of the body.

                    Ecosystem: Mangrove trees are the central living structural element in tidal
                    wetlands. They hold the shifting sands in place with their multi-stalked aerial
                    root systems. Mangrove trees have evolved to provide enough structure to
                    hold the shifting sands in place, but they are not so rigid that they cannot
                    flex in high winds or tidal currents.

         Culture    Organisation: Companies are governed by legal structures called
                    constitutions. These documents provide the enduring framework of rules
                    and regulations that shareholders, directors and executives must follow in
                    participating in the dynamic operation of the business. If the corporate
                    constitution changes too frequently it undermines the integrity of the
                    agreements that allow people to work together effectively. If it is too rigid
                    and does not change at all over time, the business will not be able to
                    adapt to changing circumstances.

                    Economy: All modern economies measure the level and success of their
                    activities through financial frameworks called accounting systems. If
                    accounting structures are changed without good reason, it can lead to
                    inaccurate financial reporting, misallocation of resources and fraud. If
                    accounting frameworks are too static and they are not changed at all over
                    time, they may become irrelevant in an evolving economy.

               the Source Pattern, the most foundational organising principle within
               PatternDynamics™.

  Definition   The productive capacity of systems.

 Description   The Exchange Pattern represents the material, energetic and informational
               trades made between elements with unique capacities that enable the
               productivity of systems to be greater than any group of non specialized,
               non trading elements. The role of Exchange is to provide the production
               and efficiency gains of systems.

   Principle   The principle of productivity: the enduring health of a system depends on
               the appropriate balance and integration of the degree of specialization
               and the scale of trade, for a given context.

Composition    The Exchange Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
               organising pattern of all systems.

  Examples     Organism: The major organs, which act as sub systems within animals,
    Nature     specialize in unique capacities: hormone regulation by the endocrine
               system, filtration by the kidneys, pumping blood by the heart, and gaseous
               interchange by the lungs, to name but a few. The organs have evolved
               specializations which allow them to enter into relational exchange as part
               of a greater system, but many are not so highly specialized that some of
               their functions are not replicated by other organs. For instance the kidneys
               and heart have secondary endocrine functions supporting hormone
               regulation in the body.

               Ecosystem: Specialized fungi translocate mineral elements through the
               soil and deliver them to the roots of plants where they are exchanged for
               sugars produced in the plant’s leaves. If a fungus specializes to the degree
               where it can exchange with only one species of plant it may become very
               efficient, but if its plant partner disappears so will the fungus. If the fungus is
               less specialized and has a generalized capacity to trade with many species
               it may not be maximally efficient, but it will be more resilient to changes in
               plant distributions.

    Culture    Organisation: Specialist employees exchange skills like accounting,
               management, trade skills, and IT expertise in order to create productive
               business systems. If the employees are so highly specialized that they do
               not understand enough about other roles within the business to relate to
               them, then specialization has gone too far. If employees and managers are
               too generalist in their approach tasks may be covered off by a number of
               people, but they will not be done with same level of expertise or productivity.

               Economy: Economies are composed of individuals, businesses and whole
               industries that develop unique capacities and then trade to form a multi-
               scaled system of exchange. Highly specialized businesses and institutions are
               needed as economies grow more complex, but high specialization makes
               business vulnerable to market changes that marginalize the demand for their
               unique goods or services. All businesses in an economic system must find the
               balance between high specialization that brings productivity gains and more
               general capacities that allow them to adapt to changing circumstances.

                    PatternDynamics™.

       Definition   The emergence of novel adaptations within systems.

      Description   The Creativity Pattern represents the emergence of new forms and
                    processes that help systems adapt to changes in the ever changing
                    environments around them. The generation of new forms and processes is
                    a risky, energy and resource intensive act that must be balanced by the
                    successful operation of the system to support its ongoing function.

        Principle   The principle of adaptive emergence: the enduring health of a system
                    depends on the appropriate balance and integration of creative
                    experimentation on the one hand and the ongoing successful operation
                    of the system on the other, for a given context.

     Composition    The Creativity Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
                    organising pattern of all systems.

       Examples     Organism: Organisms as diverse as viruses and mammals show both minor
         Nature     adaptations to temporary changes in things like moisture availability
                    and major evolutionary leaps to accommodate permanently changed
                    circumstances, such as climate change. Any organism that places too
                    much emphasis on experimental adaptations risks using too much energy
                    innovating, thereby compromising existing productivity. On the other hand,
                    organisms that do not adapt at all or too slowly will be out-competed by
                    organisms that adapt to fit the changing circumstances better.

                    Ecosystem: Forest ecosystems display adaptive responses that allow them
                    to recover from disturbances as diverse as wind throw, land slip, human
                    harvesting, pest infestation and fire. If conditions like human harvesting place
                    a greater imperative to adapt to disturbance than the forest can manage,
                    it may be replaced by another vegetation type more suited to that type
                    of disturbance. Alternatively, if forest ecosystems are protected by humans
                    from the cycles of disturbance to which they have adapted, like fire, they may
                    lose their natural vigour and become prone to attack by things they are not
                    adapted to, like pests and disease held in check by normal disturbance events.

         Culture    Organisation: All organisations must balance the rate of creative change
                    to their systems of operation. If changes are made too frequently and
                    speculatively the energy spent by members adapting to the new changes
                    and the energy required to repair failures may compromise the health of the
                    organisation. If changes are not made frequently enough the organisation
                    may become dysfunctional by virtue of being out of step with the world
                    around it.

                    Economy: If governments make large or frequent changes to tax law
                    without consulting industry and without giving enough notice of changes,
                    business may find it difficult and resource intensive to adapt to the new
                    fiscal conditions. If government regulators are slow to change tax law to fit
                    with changed economic conditions then it may have an equally disruptive
                    effect because tax revenue may not be being collected effectively
                    enough to support the institutions required for a robust economy.

               The Dynamics Pattern is closely related to and serves as an aspect of
               the Source Pattern, the most foundational organising principle within
               PatternDynamics™.

  Definition   Any process that coordinates dynamics at the systems level.

 Description   The Dynamics Pattern represents integrated and coordinated
               systemic functioning. Systemic dynamics work to refine and adjust the
               coordination of elements and processes and their relationships through
               feedback mechanisms, iterative refinements, synergies and spontaneous
               adaptations. Small changes to systemic dynamics can have great effect
               and overuse may throw systems out of balance.

   Principle   The principle of systemic refinement: the enduring health of a system
               depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the use
               of refinements to adjust the coordination and integration of system
               processes, for a given context.

Composition    The Dynamics Pattern is a major aspect of Source, the most foundational
               organising pattern of all systems.

  Examples     Organism: The human nervous system is constantly taking measurements of
    Nature     ambient temperature which then feeds back to adjust activity levels and
               the body’s metabolic rate. If the iteration period of cycles of adjustment
               is left too long the system will swing wildly from extreme to extreme. If the
               cycles are too frequent the system will become stressed from the constant
               activity of adjustment.

               Ecosystem: Coral Reefs are formed by a symbiotic relationship between
               a calcium carbonate secreting polyp and a photosynthetic algae which
               lives within its tissues. This dynamic synergy allows these tiny creatures
               to build vast reef systems. If the individual organisms give up too much
               autonomy the reef system will lose adaptability. If the different organisms do
               not cooperate fully enough a reef system will not be possible.

    Culture    Organisation: Adjustments to business systems over many cycles helps
               improve organisational performance. If the cycles of adjustment are too
               frequent, too much energy is used up in making adjustments and not
               enough is available for productive activity. If the cycles are too infrequent,
               the organisation may drift off course and lose market share.

               Economy: Central banking institutions provide feedback that adjusts the
               rate of growth in the economy through the manipulation of interest rates.
               If the central bank cuts prime lending rates too much the economy will
               overheat as businesses borrow money and expand their operations.
               If the bank is too slow to cut rates during a slowdown the economy may
               go into recession.

       Definition   The most foundational pattern of organisation: the consciousness of the
                    origin and evolution of identity and purpose.

      Description   The Source Pattern signifies the origin of order – a system’s conscious
                    identity and purpose. When awareness of the primary pattern of any
                    system is clear and its purpose or function is clear, the parts have clear
                    roles within the larger pattern of that system. It is the conscious field of
                    identity and purpose that defines a system’s type, or pattern, that in turn
                    enacts the foundational self-organising capacity of its parts.

        Principle   The principle of Unity: the enduring health of any system depends on the
                    appropriate balance and integration of changes to a system’s unifying
                    consciousness of identity and purpose, for a given context.

     Composition    The Source Pattern signifies the primordial foundation and origin of order.
                    All other Patterns represent different aspects of Source.

       Examples     Organism: The first complex (eukaryotic) cells evolved as a new pattern of
         Nature     organisation of already existing simpler (prokaryotic) cells and bacteria. The
                    purpose of this new symbiosis was to create a system in which each of the
                    elements does better as part of the system than as a lone individual. Within
                    the identity of the eukaryotic cell some of the bacteria adapted to become
                    the power plants (mitochondria) and some adapted to become organelles
                    that capture sunlight and convert it into chemical energy (chloroplasts).

                    Ecosystem: Lichen colonies are formed through a symbiotic relationship
                    between fungi and green algae. Both a fungus and an alga have different
                    patterns of organisation as independent organisms. When in relationship
                    their joint form is distinct and identifiable as a lichen. Through the
                    symbiotic organisation of the lichen form they are able to colonize harsh
                    environments like desert where they exude compounds that stabilize the
                    shifting sands so seeds of higher plants can germinate. If conditions are
                    suitable the’ parts’ of the lichen system my revert to their original identities
                    as fungi and algae respectively.

         Culture    Organisation: The clear identity and purpose of an organic farming
                    operation is to farm without harmful chemicals so that it may provide
                    healthy food, nurture healthy soils and sustain ecosystems. Its clear identity
                    and purpose and its suitability for repairing degraded environmental
                    conditions has assisted organics to become one of the fastest growing
                    industries on the planet.

                    Economy: A community credit union lends money to and takes deposits
                    from local people and businesses only, clearly contrasting it with the
                    identity and purpose of commercial banks which operate a much wider
                    range of financial services over much larger geographical areas. The
                    dilution of larger banking institutions’ identities and purposes as they
                    diversified into insurance and the brokering of financial derivatives has
                    undermined their ongoing viability.

            PatternDynamics™       An Integral Sustainability Pattern Language for understanding, communicating
                     (also PD)     and designing solutions for the sustainability of any system at any scale.

      Pattern (also PD Pattern     A simple diagram created in PatternDynamics™ that signifies a natural
          or Pattern Diagram)      pattern of organisation.

             Systems Thinking      Systems thinking can best be explained as a capacity for understanding
                                   both the characteristics and behaviour of ‘parts’ and the patterns of
                                   organisation that form those parts into ‘wholes’– complex dynamic self-
                                   organising systems.

          What is a ‘Culture of    A culture of sustainability is a set of understandings that gives shared
              Sustainability?’     meaning to what a group thinks will makes a particular system healthier
                                   and more enduring. In PatternDynamics™ we create that meaning by using
                                   Patterns. The Pattern diagrams are a tool for learning to understand the
                                   principles of how whole systems work and for having discussions about how
                                   to improve them using systems thinking.

               What is ‘Deep       Deep Sustainability Design is a design process that is supported by a Culture
       Sustainability Design?’     of Sustainability. Any sustainability design strategy that is not supported by the
                                   culture that has to live with it will not be supported, and it will stand a high risk
                                   of failure. By building a Culture of Sustainability with the people who must use
                                   or implement the design solution, it will be meaningful to them and therefore
                                   get their support, giving it a much higher chance of success.

                 Language?’        In the case of PatternDynamics™ the symbols relate to the principles
                                   informing the design of sustainable natural systems. The word ‘Integral’
                                   signifies that PatternDynamics™ is related to ‘comprehensiveness’, ‘wholistic’
                                   approaches and the synthesizing activity of thinking about how things are
                                   put together rather than relying exclusively on the activity of analysis, which
                                   is used to pull things apart. PatternDynamics™ is based in, but not limited to,
                                   Integral Theory developed by Ken Wilber. The use of the word Sustainability
                                   indicates a relationship to configuring the human world so that it may
                                   support the natural world on which it is dependent on an ongoing basis.

      (also The Chart)    of 7 under their respective First Order Pattern as Aspects of those First
                          Order Patterns. Each Second Order Patterns is a composite of a major of
                          component of the First Order Pattern above it and a minor component of
                          the First Order Pattern to the left of it.

               Source     Source represents the most primordial and foundational Pattern at work in
                          the Universe. The Source Pattern signifies the origin of order – a system’s
                          conscious identity and purpose. When awareness of the primary pattern of
                          any system is clear and its purpose or function is clear, the parts have clear
                          roles within the larger pattern of that system.

              Aspects     Aspects are different facets of a Pattern; they could also be seen as
                          different properties of a Pattern enacted by taking different perspectives
                          on the features of that Pattern. For example, Source has multiple Aspects
                          represented by the 6 First Order Patterns. In turn, the 6 First Order Patterns
                          each have multiple Aspects represented by their seven Second Order
                          Aspects. (See the First Order Chart and the PatternDynamics™ Holarchy
                          Chart.)

                Holon     In PatternDynamics the term Holon signifies a perspective on the nature of
                          systems, where systems have the property of parts organized into wholes, but
                          also the property of having both interior, subjective dimensions and exterior,
                          material dimensions. A Holon refers to a system seen as fundamentally
                          composed of four perspectives: parts, wholes, interiors and exteriors.

done in a number of ways and it’s probably much easier than you think.

When PatternDynamics™ is being used for personal and not-for-profit

In any situation where PD or any of its resources are being used as part of
the official activities of a named or incorporated organisation – for instance
in organisational communications, strategic planning, as an organisational

by an organisation and therefore no longer ‘personal’ use. Any use of
PatternDynamics™ where anyone or any organisation is charging money
