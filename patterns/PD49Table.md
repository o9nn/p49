           The Resonance Pattern represents the sympathetic
      coordination of elements within a system. Resonance is one
     aspect of the more foundational First Order Pattern, Rhythm.
                            Resonance demonstrates
     how parts of a system organise harmoniously through fields of
    subtle interconnections. The strength of the resonant field must
        be balanced so that elements are coordinated through
        harmonic influences, but retain the ability for concurrent
      independent expression. The role of Resonanceis harmonic
                                  coordination.
S    The principle of field harmonics: the enduring health and evolution of any
        system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the
         influence of the harmonic field with the capacity for independent
                                    expression.
