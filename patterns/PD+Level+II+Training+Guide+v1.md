                                 Recurrent Order

### Description:

         The Repetition Pattern represents simple ongoing recurrences in both
         time, as repeated processes, and in space, as repeated forms. It is one
         aspect of the more foundational First Order Pattern, Rhythm. Repetition
         demonstrates an energetic savings through the ability to reliably reproduce
         functionality. The reliability and energy savings of Repetition must be
         balanced with the need to change and adapt, which requires variation
         and risk to reliability. The role of Repetition is to provide reliability.

### Principle:

         The principle of simple recurrence: the enduring health of any system
         depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the reliability of
         the repetition of functional processes and forms and the need for variation
         that helps adapt those processes and forms to changing circumstances,
         for a given context.

                                  Rhythmic Duality

### Description:

           The Expand/Contract Pattern signifies a fundamental duality or opposition
           within any rhythmic movement or event. It is one aspect of the more
           foundational Pattern, Polarity. Expand/Contract demonstrates the
           relationship and interplay between the growth phase and the decline
           phase of any repeated activity or process. The duration and force of any
           growth phase must be balanced with the duration and force of its decline
           phase. The role of Expand/Contract is to liberate energy through rhythmic
           interplay.

### Principle:

           The principle of rhythmic interplay: the enduring health of any system
           depends on the appropriate balance and integration of any expansive
           movement with its related contractive movement, for a given context.

### Description:

            The Boundary Pattern represents the design of the limiting edge of a
            system. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Structure.
            Boundary demonstrates the perimeter frame or border that defines a
            system and determines what may come into and what may go out of a
            system. Permeability, which allows the movement of elements into and out
            of the system, must be balanced with structural integrity, which defines the
            system through the separation of the elements inside and outside of the
            system. The role of Boundary is to maintain distinctions.

### Principle:

            The principle of edge design: the enduring health of any system depends
            on the balance and integration of structural definition and well designed
            permeability of edge structures, for a given context.

                                  Exchange Phases

### Description:

           The Cycle Pattern represents the circuit of phases involved in the
           interchange processes that characterize the operation of a system. It is
           one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Exchange. Cycle illustrates
           the rhythmic, repeated sequence of actions that form an iterative circuit
           in trade flows. The duration and activity level of the phases needs to be
           balanced to ensure free flowing exchanges. The role of Cycle is to provide
           a sequence of repeated phases in any process.

### Principle:

           The principle of cyclic exchanges: the enduring health of any system
           depends on the balance and integration of the phases in the iterative
           circuit of any exchange process, for a given context.
