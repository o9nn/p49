PatternDynamics™ Source Course
Explanation: Source is related to your ultimate purpose as an organization. When it is co-created, widespread, clear, and
present it forms a central organizing principle of that system. This 'course on a page' is designed to get you up and running
with a powerful system thinking principle that will help you coordinate perspectives. Evaluating perspectives in this way will
help you generate new insights for better decision making.

Instructions: Choose a topic or issue that is important to you, record it below, and read the descriptions of the three
dimensions of Source. See if you can place an 'X' on each slider bar that indicates how you (or another) is thinking about this
issue.

 Topic/Issue: .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

                                             Part                                                                                                                                          Whole

                          Short Term                                                                                                                                                       Long Term

                                  Tangible                                                                                                                                                  Intangible

Part/Whole: All systems are composed of a series of parts that come together to form an integrated whole. Does your
thinking (or another's) relate more strongly to outcomes for a part of your organization or more to results for the organization
as a whole? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Part/Whole slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between
these two polarities.

Short Term/Long Term: To function optimally all systems must balance achieving short term outcomes with long term goals.
Does your thinking (or another's) relate more strongly to achieving short term outcomes or more to working towards long
term aims and objectives? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Short Term/Long Term slider bar above that represents where
your thinking sits between these two polarities.

Tangible/Intangible: All systems require the creation and maintenance of both tangible value that can be objectively
measured (like ﬁnancial outcomes) and more intangible value that tends to be evaluated subjectively (like the quality of
relationships or the level of trust). Does your thinking on this issue (or another's) relate more strongly to creating tangible
value for the organization or relate more to creating intangible value? See if you can draw an 'X' on the Tangible/Intangible
slider bar above that represents where your thinking sits between these two polarities.

Rationale Support Framework
Argumentation (rationale) is how you explain the reasoning behind your decision in a coherent,
convincing, and authoritative manner. Doing this increases your inﬂuence as a decision maker and
leader.

Below is a framework that will help you support your argumentation based on the decision making
skills you have learned in this practice.

Tension Sensing: I sensed an informative tension related to (this issue/topic) ________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________________
in myself and/or others by observing these sensations/emotions/reﬂections/intuitions…

Source Tracking: This issue/topic relates back to the ultimate purpose of our organization through the
following pathway…

Perspective Taking: I identiﬁed the following stakeholder perspectives as important for a good
understanding of this issue/topic and I imagined what they thought as follows…

Perspective Seeking: Given the limited time and resources available for making this decision I chose to
directly enquire and actually verify the nature of these perspectives ________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________________ .
This is how I’ve interpreted what they told me…

Collaborative Thinking: I engaged in enquiring communication, facilitation and/or mentoring to learn
about these perspectives _____________________________________________________________________
and to bring them into the decision making process in the following ways…

Perspective Coordination: I learned more about the conﬂicts and tensions between the people and
groups involved in this decision and I sought to resolve these tensions by locating this/these principles
that show their common ground...

Systems Thinking: This/these Patterns help identify the overarching principles that help unite these
perspectives…

Note: Source is a Pattern you can always start with.

Rationale: I am using the information from this exercise to craft the presentation of the arguments
supporting my decision in the following ways…

Decision Making: I moved from deliberating about this decision to taking action by using this/these
creative insight(s) ____________________________________________________________________________
based on this/these unifying principles_______________________________________________________ …

Decision Guide
“Decision implies the end of deliberation and the beginning of action.”

                                 William Starbuck, professor in residence at the University of Oregon’s Charles H. Lundquist College of Business.

Methods: There is no magic formula for deciding on a course of action. All good decisions are made using a combination of

### these methods:

- Analysis
- Logical reasoning
- Intuition
- Emotion

### Elements: Good decisions also take into account these elements:

- The causes of a challenge
- The goals that need to be met
- Different decision making options
- The perceived outcomes of different options

Often Practiced: Many currently taught decision making processes involve listing all the options recommended by different
stakeholders and choosing the one with the most strengths and the least weaknesses for the widest range of stakeholders.
This strategy involves deciding on compromises and trade offs.

Better Practice: Better decision making, supported by the method being advocated here, relies on ﬁnding the hidden
commonalities between seemingly divergent perspectives and using these as leverage points to formulate creative solutions.
These solutions are intended to meet more of all of the stakeholders’ needs. Note: the most important and reliable
commonality for uniting perspectives is their relationship and importance to the purpose (Source) of the organization, unit,
group, or team.

PatternDynamics™ First Order Pattern Definitions

In plain language: The Rhythm Pattern represents everything in your organization that has to do
with cycles in time. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within the PatternDynamics™ framework.

Deﬁnition: The Rhythm Pattern represents the repetitions, swings, pulses, synchronizations and other
regularities of processes that characterize a system’s unfolding in time. The role of Rhythm is to coordinate
elements and events in time. Rhythm demonstrates the effectiveness of regular patterns in time that assist
elements of a system to engage in coordinated processes. Rhythms must be balanced so that, on the one
hand, their regularity does not become ﬁxed, which may cause problems if conditions require change; or, on
the other hand, change too often or too quickly, which can pose unnecessary or costly adaptive challenges
for the rest of the system.

In plain language: The Polarity Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your
organization that has to do with things that seem like opposites, but are often just two different sides
of the same coin. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within the PatternDynamics™ framework.

Deﬁnition: The Polarity Pattern represents opposing forces as two ends of a continuum in dynamic
interplay.The role of Polarity is to build and liberate the potential within systems. The relationship between
polarities stores potential and their integration liberates energies that drive the activity of systems. On the
one hand, Polarities must be integrated to take advantage of both approaches, but, on the other hand,
they must also be maintained to build potential.
In plain language: The Structure Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your
organization that has to do with its supporting frameworks. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within
the PatternDynamics™ framework.
Deﬁnition: The Structure Pattern represents the solid, relatively unchanging, frameworks, scaffolding or
‘bones’ of a system. The role of Structure is to support the more active and changeable aspects of systems.
Structure demonstrates the effectiveness of having enduring frameworks that support the more dynamic
activity. Structural frameworks, on the one hand, must be the most solid, unchanging, and enduring aspects
of a system, but, on the other hand, they must also have some capacity for ready, if limited, ﬂexibility.

In plain language: The Exchange Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your
organization that has to do with trades of energy and resources between its different people and
groups. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within the PatternDynamics™ framework.

Deﬁnition: The Exchange Pattern represents the material, energetic and informational trades made between
specialized elements of a system. The role of Exchange is to provide the production and efﬁciency gains of
systems. Exchanges between elements with unique capabilities demonstrates the productivity and efﬁciency
gains of systems that allows them to outcompete any group of non-specialized, non-trading elements.
Exchanges must be balanced so that, one the one hand, elements within a system specialize enough that
through trade the system gains a competitive advantage; but, on the other hand, elements retain the ability to
cover off more than one function so as to ensure resilience.

In plain language: The Creativity Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your
organization that has to do with emergent new opportunities. Below is its more precise deﬁnition
within the PatternDynamics™ framework.

Deﬁnition: The Creativity Pattern represents the emergence of new forms and processes within systems. The
role of Creativity is to help systems adapt to changes in the ever-changing environments around them.
Creativity demonstrates the large gains that can be made through successful innovation. Creativity must be
balanced so that, on the one hand, a system gains the beneﬁts of successful innovation; but, on the other
hand, it does not become exhausted through continually expending energy on uncertain experiments.

In plain language: The Dynamics Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your
organization that has to do with systems level change. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within the
PatternDynamics™ framework

Deﬁnition: The Dynamics Pattern represents integration, coordination, and control at the systems level itself.
The role of Dynamics is to provide highly leveraged means for integrating, coordinating and controlling
systems level operations that support the attainment of goals. Dynamics demonstrates the often very highly
leveraged effects of integrations, coordination, and control at the systems level. Dynamics must be balanced
so that, on the one hand, integration, coordination, and control processes are effectively leveraged for
meeting goals; but, on the other hand, care must be taken not to apply too much leverage causing systems
dynamics to be thrown out of control.

In plain language: The Source Pattern represents the principle behind everything in your organization
that has to do with its ultimate purpose. Below is its more precise deﬁnition within the
PatternDynamics™ framework.

Deﬁnition: The Source Pattern is most simply represented as a system’s purpose. It’s more complete
deﬁnition is that it signiﬁes the quality of the collective awareness of the ongoing evolution of a system’s
purpose, essential nature, or 'Source Code'. The role of Source is to serve as the core collective inquiry:
“What is the origin and evolution our identity and purpose?” Source demonstrates the power of collective
inquiry to generate awareness that strengthens the self-organizing drive all systems have to co-create the
conditions that allow them to meet their aims and thrive. Source must be balanced so that, on the one
hand, a strong connection is maintained to the origin of a system’s identity and purpose; but, on the other
hand, a strong inquiry is maintained that allows that same identity and purpose to evolve in a way that helps
it thrive under changing circumstances.                                                                       9
                                                                                    www.patterndynamics.net
