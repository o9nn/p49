                                         Context
      As the world becomes more complex, social and organisational challenges can no
      longer be met using outdated, simplistic traditional structures.

      Dealing with the complexity challenge requires a sustainable transition to a more
      sophisticated, adaptive, Living Systems Operating Model.

 System Overview

                                     Why PD ?

### Many alternative operating models require:

- mass uptake to become eﬀective
- big structural changes that are diﬃcult to complete
- overly disruptive interventions that often impede eﬀectiveness
- high stakes reorganisations that pose a risk of chaotic breakdown

         A better approach is a sustainable transition to a more suitable operating model.

 System Overview

     Requisite Literacy for a Planetary World
       PatternDynamics™ helps people gain ecologically orientated systems thinking skills
       that allow them to understand, communicate, and problem solve more successfully
       in an increasingly complex world.

       It forms a basic systems thinking literacy that can be easily and seamlessly
       “plugged in” to any organisation or community process to assist with the shift to a
       more adaptive operating model.
