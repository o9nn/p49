PatternDynamics             Learning Pathways Guide

 Welcome to the PD Learning Pathways Guide. We hope you will find your time in our

  organisation and how it applies in your own contexts, to make a difference and get
            outcomes that help us thrive in an increasingly complex world.
Quick Start Guide

Learning Pathways Guide

Context and Purpose
The purpose of this Forum Training Community is to help you learn a practice of living systems organisation, which is a form of
self-organisation, based on purpose-driven, collaborative systems thinking. It is designed to support your skill development as a
change agent, facilitator, coach, leader, or simply concerned human, in creating the more positive, open, participatory
communities required to manage the complexity of the shift to a thriving planetary scale civilisation.
Learning Pathways Guide (cont.)

Our Theory of Change
At PatternDynamics, our theory of change is that we start with ourselves. In that regard, it starts as a personal practice, that
can equip you with skills to enable wiser decision making and more complex problem solving when you work in groups. It may
be used as an organisational practice, but in our view, this should arise organically as the results of your practice become
influential.

Pedagogy
Post-formal and planetary: Our approach to learning is collaborative and based on research from the learning sciences. Our
aim is to provide community-supported learning pathways for the development of post-formal skills in purpose-driven,
collaborative systems thinking, decision-making, and complex problem solving as they apply to facilitating more effective group
self-organisation. It is our belief that this is a requirement for better managing the levels of complexity inherent in the shift to a
planetary scale civilisation.

General Forums
Under Start Here, you will find a Quick Start Guide to get you immediately engaged with PatternDynamics and learning the principles of
living systems organisation.

The Welcome Video from Founder Tim Winton is an overview of the PatternDynamics System and what you can learn in this forum
training community.

Under Introduce Yourself, you have the opportunity to share a little about who you are and why you’ve joined the FTC.

Learning Pathways Guide is where you can download this document, and you can come back to it and download it again at any time. Any
updates to the learning pathway will be added to this document and available in the Learning Pathways forum thread.

The Guidelines of Forum Engagement, including our ethics, are also available in this Forum, and we recommend you read them before
engaging with the online community.

The General Discussion Forum is the place for generalised PD discussions. This is where you can create your own threads on PD-
related topics that interest you. This is for any discussion topics that don’t fit under more specific forums, threads or topics. You can ask
questions, post comments, and engage with the wider PD community on any generalised PD topics.
Training Forums

All the training and course materials for PatternDynamics can be accessed through the Training Forums.

Your FTC membership gives you access to all the training videos for Level I, Level II and advanced material around the PD
Model and PD Operating System.

Related material, such as PDF Presentations, Workbooks and other support material can also be downloaded here.
Additional Material

Under the Additional Material Forum you have access to over 100 hours of video recordings of PD Founder Tim Winton on
permaculture and eco-literacy training – training that informed the development of PD over the years. This material
demonstrates the practical application of PatternDynamics Patterns and principles to applied sustainability and permaculture
design.

Please note that the comments threads for the Permaculture and Eco-Literacy Training have been disabled. Any comments on
this material can be posted in the General Forum.

Any further additional materials, such as recorded webinars or talks etc will be added here as they become available.
Accredited and Non-Accredited Learning Pathways

There are two key ways to engage with the PatternDynamics Training - Non Accredited and Accredited pathways.

1. Non-Accredited Learning Pathway

This is a self-paced pathway that allows you full access to the PD training videos, all training materials, and the regular Forum
Training Community. You can work your way through the training materials provided, complete the training exercises, engage
with the community, and enjoy the free periodic webinars and recordings that will be available.

The self-paced, non-accredited pathway means you are free to utilise PD for personal, non-commercial purposes. Click here to

 PatternDynamics Level 1 Training
The recommended approach is to view one set of First Order Pattern videos per week, review it in the Training Guide, identify and
          reflect on this pattern in your own context, and comment in the Forum about your experiences/learnings.

1. Watch the Source Course video and download the Source Course Worksheet
2. Identify an opportunity to apply the Source Course principles in a personal or group context, and write about your reflections in the Forum. Your
    reflections should focus on how adjusting the balance associated with each principle could have made a difference in this context.
3. Reply to at least two other community members comments as well. Ongoing discussions about these principles with others will deepen your
    learning. Post any questions that are not answered by community members to Tim or other Forum Moderators
4. Download the PD Level I Training Guide and Level I Workshop Workbook
5. Watch the Introduction video, referencing the PD Level I Training Guide and Workshop Workbook resources as required
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each of the First Order patterns: Rhythm, Polarity, Structure, Exchange, Creativity, Dynamics and Source over the following
    weeks
7. For the Accreditation Pathway, when you have completed the Level I training videos and exercises, send a copy of your comments and replies for
    the Introduction (Source Course), and each of the First Order Patterns to info@patterndynamics.net with ‘PD Level I Accreditation Application’ in
    the subject line. There is no additional fee for this. When your submission is successful, we will email you the Level I PD Accredited Personal
    Practitioner logo
8. Your accreditation is current while you remain a member of the FTC. Re-accreditation after a hiatus is assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on
    the state of your practice

                                Stay tuned for periodic live calls and webinars with Tim or other Accredited PD Practitioners to support your learning
 PatternDynamics Level II Training
A deep dive into the 49 Second Order Patterns and the application of collaborative systems thinking to building decision-making
skills. In this training, you will be introduced to Lectical learning tools through completing their Leadership Decision Making
Assessment (LDMA). Accredited PD Level II training operates on the self-organising principles inherent in PD.

1.   Form a ‘cluster’ of 8 or 9 people with a desire for Level II Accreditation (to develop or find a cluster, go to Find My Cluster in the PD Level II training forum)
2.   When you have your cluster, contact info@patterndynamics.net and advise of your intention. We will respond with the next available schedule for your
      training
3.   Each PD Level II Training Cluster will engage in 10 weeks of online training
4.   The small group training consists of
- approximately two hours per week of live online ‘class’ time with Tim Winton (recorded if you are not able to make a session)
- reviewing the Level II videos
- reviewing the Level II Training Guide and each of the 49 Second Order Patterns
- reflection and application questions, comments and replies in your private cluster forum
- The Lectica Decision Making Assessment (LDMA) and group debrief
- An additional fee per cluster member (approximately $1500 USD)
5.   There is a maximum of four clusters per year
6.   Your accreditation is current while you remain a member of the FTC. Re-accreditation after a hiatus is assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the state
      of your practice
 PatternDynamics Level III Training

 PatternDynamics Workshop FacilitationTraining
 After completion of a live PatternDynamics Workshop and PD Level II Accredited Training, members may apply for Workshop
 Facilitation Accreditation Training. This consists of mentoring with an Accredited PD Workshop Facilitator in a live workshop
 context. Please email info@patterndynamics.net for more information.
