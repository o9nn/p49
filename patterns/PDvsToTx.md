            Specialization and Trade

‘Exchange’ signifies the productive capacity of systems.

‘Exchange’ signifies the productive capacity of systems.
All natural systems have productive processes driven by specialized elements exchanging energy and
materials with each other. Flowers distribute nectar as a natural energy product in an exchange with
insects and animals that do the work of distributing the plant’s pollen. This is a more efficient and
therefore more productive outcome than if the flower had to organize its own pollination and the insects
and animals had to photosynthesize their own sugars from sunlight energy.

- What role do exchanges play within a system?

- Think about what an organisation would be like if it did not have a unique role within the economy that
 allowed it to create products or services competitively so as to become a desirable trading partner.

- What would a business be like that tried to be an extreme generalist and work in a multitude of
 unrelated industries?

- Alternatively, what would it be like to be so highly specialized that your role was only infrequently
 required within an organisation?

- How do you choose the appropriate level of specialization? How does trade amongst specialists make
 everybody better off?

- How could you balance an existing Exchange or integrate a new one into a system in your life to
 improve how it is organised?

- How do exchanges serve to coordinate systems?

Description
Significance: The Exchange Pattern represents the
material, energetic and informational trades made
between specialized elements of a system.
Role: The role of Exchange is to provide the production
and efficiency gains of systems.

Effect: Exchanges between elements with unique
capabilities demonstrates the productivity and
effeciency gains of systems that allows them to
outcompete any group of non-specialized, non-trading
elements.
Balance: Exchanges must be balanced so that, one the
one hand, elements within a system specialize enough
that through trade the system gains a competitive
advantage; but, on the other hand, elements retain the
ability to cover off more than one function so as to
ensure resilience.

### within animals’ bodies, specialize in unique capacities:

hormone regulation by the endocrine system, filtration
by the kidneys, pumping blood by the heart, and
gaseous interchange by the lungs–to name but a few.
Organs have evolved specializations that allow them to
enter into relational exchanges as part of a greater
system, but many are not so highly specialized that they
cannot cover off the function of other organs. For
instance the kidneys and heart have secondary
endocrine functions supporting hormone regulation in
the body.

Inquiry: What purpose does it serve to have something
like endocrine function covered by more than one
element in the body?

Nature: Organisms, Ecosystems, and Biosphere

Ecosystem: Specialized fungi translocate mineral elements
through the soil and deliver them to the roots of plants
where they are exchanged for sugars produced in the
plant’s leaves. If a fungus specializes to the degree where
it can exchange with only one species of plant it may
become very efficient, but if its plant partner disappears so
will the fungus. If the fungus is less specialized and has a
generalized capacity to trade with many species it may
not be maximally efficient, but it will be more resilient to
changes in plant distributions.

Inquiry: What would happen to a pollinating insect that
specialized in pollinating only one particular kind of plant if
that plant became endangered?

Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems

Organizations: Specialist employees exchange skills like
accounting, management, trade skills, and IT expertise in
order to create productive business systems. If the
employees are so highly specialized that they do not
understand enough about other roles within the business
to relate to them, or in a pinch fill in for them, then
specialization may have gone too far. If employees and
managers are too general in their abilities, tasks may be
covered off by a number of people, but they will not be
done with maximum levels of expertise or productivity.

Inquiry: In different kinds of organization is it appropriate to
have differing levels of the degree to which people
specialize in their skills? If so, why?

Examples
Culture: Individuals, Organizations, and Socio/Economic Systems

Socio-Economic Systems: Economies are composed of
individuals, businesses and whole industries that develop
unique capacities and then trade to form a multi-scaled
system of exchange. Highly specialized businesses and
institutions are needed as economies grow more complex,
but high specialization makes business vulnerable to
market changes that marginalize the demand for their
unique goods or services. All businesses in an economic
system must find the balance between high specialization
that brings productivity gains and more general capacities
that allow them to adapt to changing circumstances.

Inquiry: In a period of volatile and uncertain market
conditions should a business increase its specialization to
drive productivity or increase its adaptive ability by investing
in the ability to produce a more flexible range of products?

                                  Exchange Phases

### Description:

           The Cycle Pattern represents the circuit of phases involved in the
           interchange processes that characterize the operation of a system. It is
           one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Exchange. Cycle illustrates
           the rhythmic, repeated sequence of actions that form an iterative circuit
           in trade flows. The duration and activity level of the phases needs to be
           balanced to ensure free flowing exchanges. The role of Cycle is to provide
           a sequence of repeated phases in any process.

### Principle:

           The principle of cyclic exchanges: the enduring health of any system
           depends on the balance and integration of the phases in the iterative
           circuit of any exchange process, for a given context.

m    As a symbol interacts with another symbol, its dyad fluctuates, and so does its
s    c-ratio. In turn, the fluctuations in complexity force patterns to move between
     the symbols. Thermodynamics explains the displacement of particles between
     bodies on the small scale. However, large symbols in mindspace will exchange
     large masses of patterns that look like consumer products, documents, people,
     and other massive arrangements of particles. The goal of each symbol is to
- capture patterns to fuel its lifespan vis-a-vis any competitors. Note that organi-
s    zations found to be stuck within any particular phase of growth or change, will
     appear uneconomical, frustrated, and will eventually waste its time.

### Description:

The Pattern Pattern signiﬁes repeated types of order. It is a Second
Order aspect of the central and most foundational Pattern in the
Patterndynamics™ system, Source. Pattern illustrates recurrent design
arrangements that order parts into particular styles of dynamically functioning
forms. Restrictive patterns of recurrent dynamically unfolding order need to be
balanced with unordered states with high potential for new arrangements. The
role of Pattern is to provide successful templates of systemic design.

### Principle:

The principle of potential and restrictiveness of form: the enduring health
and evolution of any system requires the appropriate balance and integration
of restrictive highly patterned forms and unrestricted states of low order, but
high potential, for a given context.

                          Primordial Duality

### Description:

The Concentration / Diffusion Pattern signiﬁes a foundational duality within
systems. It is one aspect of the First Order Pattern, Polarity. Concentration /
Diffusion demonstrates the importance of concentrated, interconnected centers
of activity that are supported by and in turn support surrounding areas of less
concentrated interconnectedness, but more abundant, resources. The
dedication of resources to the concentrated center must be balanced with the
capacity of the outlying areas to supply resources sustainably. The role of
Concentration / Diffusion is to leverage the advantages of intensive centers of
production, creativity, and exchange.

### Principle:

The principle of complex interconnections: the enduring health of any
system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of the ﬂow of
resources to concentrated centers with the necessity for the advantages
generated in those centers to be distributed to nurture and support the
activities of the supplying hinterlands.

creative process. It is one aspect of the more foundational First Order Pattern,
Polarity. Order / Chaos demonstrates the relationship and interplay between
states of orderly functionality and states of breakdown and irregularity. Orderly
states must be balanced against periods of breakdown that allow the
rearrangement of previously ﬁxed elements into new, more appropriate forms.
The role of Order / Chaos is to facilitate adaptation and evolution.

### Principle:

The principle of creative breakdown: the enduring health of any
system depends on the appropriate balance and integration of periods of
structured function with periods of breakdown and reorganisation, for a given
context.

## NETWORK

All living beings are conduits for a force of nature called attraction. Attraction
is an assembly process forcing an order between circles and lines within mind-
space, and it combats against the perceived flow of time, entropy and disorder.

## ATTRACTION                                                                                                  138

         In thought theory, energy is contained by the circles and lines of mindspace.
      Chaos is the natural state of energy, meaning that without a process of
      order the circles and lines become randomly dispersed. Thought theory’s
      principle of Attraction explains how dis-ordered patterns are re-arranged
      naturally in mindspace. Attraction’s relational pulling force can be defined in
      a physical and abstract manner. In the physical space, attraction manifests as
      gravity and electromagnetism between objects, but in the abstract space,
      it manifests as concentration and interaction between symbols. Notice in
      the next two paragraphs, how I simply compare the notions of our physical

### nature with those of the abstract space:

        Let us start with the physical space. Gravity is the force of attraction
      exerted by the size of an object. It is a force that pulls smaller organizations
      into larger organizations, so it mainly works between organizations of differ-
      ent scales. For example, gravity is exerted between you and the Earth and it
      feels like an inescapable pulling force. Electromagnetism, on the other hand,
      is emitted as a line and it works between organizations of similar scale. For
      example, electromagnetism keeps a pen between your fingers. Your fingers,
      the part of your body that interacts with the pen, is on a similar scale than the
      pen. It’s important to realize that electromagnetism feels like manipulating
      matter while gravitation feels like absorption.

        Let us move onto the abstract space. Concentration is the force of attraction
      that is bound to the circle. It is a force that pulls smaller organizations into larger
      organizations. So it works between organizations of different scales. For example,
      concentration is exerted between you and the Earth and it feels like ‘attention’ and
      admiration. Concentration creates awareness. The other abstract force of attrac-
      tion is called interaction. It is bound to the line and it works between organizations
      of similar scale. For example, interaction works between a pen and your fingers.
      Although your mind may concentrate on a subject to write about, interaction
      causes your fingers to move a pen while thinking about the subject. Its important
      to realize that interaction feels complex, while concentration feels simple.
- Overall, attraction brings people, objects, ideas and events together and it also
 r.   crosses into decision-making and behavioral patterns. Any two things that

## ATTRACTION                                                                        139

e.   move closer together are under the influence of attraction, whether it’s planets,
 f   people, or letters on a page. The physical and abstract notions of attraction
 s   must be considered when calculating the motion of matter, because people
d    and objects are displaced by forces of attraction exerted on a physical and
n    intellectual level, at the same time.
e,   There is another mindspace principle called Negation that mitigates
n    Attraction and gives systems the ability to separate. Negation emerges
al   from the four dimensions of waves and opposes Attraction in many philo-
     sophical respects. It is a fundamental principle that comes about from the
     ‘outside region of the circle’, and results in destructive complexity.
s    Here’s a common generalization about gravity: objects with the greatest size
- exert the greatest amounts of gravity. Consider that the largest mountain on
 t   the planet, containing the most atoms and mass, is Mt. Everest. I have
d,   proposed that gravity and concentration are the same force, and that
 r   concentration can be understood as attention or awareness. Therefore, Mt.
s,   Everest must generate the most amount of awareness since its the biggest
e    mountain. So what is awareness? Consider the thousands of people who
g    discuss Mt. Everest every day. When people think about a relatively broad
     subject, that’s awareness, and it’s part of the concentrative process. But
     does Everest attract the most visitors because of its concentrative force? It
n    turns out that Mt. Fuji is the world’s most visited mountain, and it’s much
 r   smaller than Everest. So what’s really forcing people to move towards Mt.
e,   Fuji, since it must produce less awareness from its lesser size? The answer
d    is that Mt. Fuji contains a higher complexity than Everest. Fuji has ski parks,
- restaurants, and other ‘attractions’, that spring from highly connected
s    arrangements of patterns. It may not be the most physically massive moun-
s.   tain, but it is the most intelligently organized. Its intelligent arrangements
n    provide it with a higher interactive component that provide it with ‘abstract’
 t   forms of mass. Its abstract mass exerts additional units of attraction that
     pulls on the bodies of people. So a large physical mass will cause people to        B
     become attentive and aware, but a large abstract mass forces people to              p
o    approach it physically. I believe that these concepts can be applied to every-      a
     thing we think about and engage with.                                               t

### Description:

The Competition / Cooperation Pattern signiﬁes a fundamental duality
at the systems level. It is one aspect of the more foundational First
Order Pattern, Polarity. Competition / Cooperation demonstrates the
relationship and interplay between individual striving for supremacy
and group collaboration for mutual assistance. The performance gains from
competitive dynamics need to be balanced with the synergies
of cooperative interactions. The role of Competition / Cooperation is to
enhance functionality at the systems level.

### Principle:

d   In thought theory, the complete notion of a symbolic organization requires two    S

a   have value, while the line transfers them to other organizations. In a physical   d
o   sense, the line can be a pathway that exchanges something tangible. While in      s
- an abstract sense it can be a pathway that exchanges something intangible.        t

### Description:

The Field Pattern represents resonant shaping forces, some of which may be
difﬁcult to explain given our current level of understanding. It is one aspect of
the more foundational Pattern, Structure. Field illustrates subtle resonant
inﬂuences that shape similarities in order between seemingly unrelated
structural forms. Reliance on subtle inﬂuences needs to be balanced with the
use of more concrete structural elements and forms. The role of Field is to
provide the subtle resonant patterns that order parts into classes of
recognisable wholes.

### Principle:

The principle of subtle structures: the enduring health of any system
depends on the balance and integration of the subtle patterning of structures
with more concrete structural elements and forms, for a given context.

                          Hierarchy
                          Essential Structure

### Description:

The Hierarchy Pattern signiﬁes an essential property of the design of
any system. It is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Structure.
Hierarchy illustrates the ranking of levels of a system based on the number of
elements in each level. The concentration of control functions with
the few at the top of the triangle must be balanced with the diffusion of inﬂuence
in the many at the bottom. The role of Hierarchy is to generate a gain based on
supporting a concentration of control at the peak and the peak in turn
disseminating the gains based on coordinated control to the supporting base.

### Principle:

The principle of control as service: the enduring health of any system
depends on the balance and integration of the concentrated control at the peak
and the more numerous, but more diffuse, supporting inﬂuence at the base of
any hierarchy.

## HIERARCHIES

## HIERARCHY

    Organizations utilize their complex substructures of relationships to interact   C
    and move across mindspace. As they interact, they merge, build, and appear       t
    to destroy each other. I think it can be said that life is birthed when a mind   b
y   develops self-will, and organizations that act upon the distinction between      t
f   themselves and their environment demonstrate willfulness. How does the           s
a   architecture of mindspace generate will, and does will even exist? Do the        e
e   rules guiding the unconscious mind create will for each of us (as the uncon-     t
s   scious mind displaces symbols according to some metaphysical laws)? Also,        is
- should will power be increasingly considered an environmental and societal
    issue, instead of a strictly personal one?

### Description:

The Network Pattern signiﬁes the inter-connective architecture of relationships
between elements in a system. It is one aspect of the more foundational
Pattern, Structure. Network demonstrates the node and pathway organisational
pattern. The individuality and independence of nodes must be balanced with
the strength of relationships between them. The role of Network is to provide
organizational clarity through interconnected distinctions.

### Principle:

The principle of nodes and pathways: the enduring health of any system
depends on the balance and integration of the strength of relationships with
the concentrated integrity of nodes, for a given context.

### Description:

The Complexity Pattern represents the number of elements and the number of
connections between them in a system. It is one aspect of the more
foundational Pattern, Structure. Complexity illustrates the structuring of
relationships between unique elements of a system. The capacity for numerous
unique elements with large numbers of connections needs to be balanced with
simpler, more manageable, less complicated arrangements. The role of
Complexity is to creatively conﬁgure high degrees of order within systems.

### Principle:

The principle of interrelationships: the enduring health of any system
depends on the balance and integration of large numbers of unique elements
in multiple relationships and lesser numbers of elements and relationships, for
a given context.

### Description:

The Balance Pattern signiﬁes the dynamic equilibrium of relational reciprocity. It
is one aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Exchange. Balance illustrates
the energy generated through reciprocal giving and receiving in trade between
elements of a system. Giving must be dynamically balanced with receiving.
The role of Balance is to generate systemic energy through exchanges.

### Principle:

The principle of equitable exchange: the enduring health of any system
depends on the dynamic equilibrium between giving and receiving, for a given
context.

e.   The final stage of the mechanism forces a balance for the growth phase. It is
h    akin to sleep and the unconscious, because it is a process that happens
- between the phases of growth and change. It’s an ordering phase that extends
     from our commonly held notions of equilibrium. I believe that equilibrium can be
     explained in three slightly different, and somewhat conflicting manners: The
o    first is by explaining its usage in physics as a function of disorder. According to
al   the perspective of physicists, the Universe is always moving towards equilibrium
e    and randomness; meaning that energy wants to be evenly dispersed across the
     universe. For this reason, two nearby gases of different temperatures are
     forced to equilibrate their particles. There is also a second notion of equilibrium
r    that applies to intelligent structures. In this case, I believe that equilibrium      A
r.   represents some midpoint within a struggle between order and disorder. This           c
n    means that as intelligent beings, we are constantly fighting the notion of com-
                                                                                           th
e    plete disorder, and random dispersion. We are naturally forced by attraction into
     establishing an equilibrium between disorder and order. In the third case, as
                                                                                           la
     found in the fundamental mechanism, equilibrium acts to balance the distribu-

     tion of physical particles with the distribution of patterns in mindspace, because
e    the matter found within our environments must be reflective of pattern distribu-      c

     the periodic management of an environment.                                            a

### Description:

The Cycle Pattern represents the circuit of phases involved in the interchange
processes that characterize the operation of a system. It is one aspect of the
more foundational Pattern, Exchange. Cycle illustrates the rhythmic, repeated
sequence of actions that form an iterative circuit in trade ﬂows. The duration and
activity level of the phases needs to be balanced to ensure free ﬂowing
exchanges. The role of Cycle is to provide a sequence of repeated phases in
any process.

### Principle:

The principle of cyclic exchanges: the enduring health of any system
depends on the balance and integration of the phases in the iterative circuit of
any exchange process, for a given context.

The Growth Pattern represents developmental increase. It is one aspect of the

additions through cycles of creative exchange between specialised elements of
a system. Compounding increases must be balanced with the resources
available to meet exponential growth. The role of growth is to create resources

      Let’s consider a factory and a consumer: a factory is a supply-oriented organiza-           la

  t   In doing so, it accumulates matter, or more precisely, it accumulates the possibility       k
n     of matter. The growth phase represents the first phase of work, which collects              m
e,    patterns in abstraction. If patterns are well-collected, inventory will appear within       it
n     the factory’s environment as the balancing phase is completed. A great way of
a     understanding the process of growth is by comparing it to the idea of work. The             C

The Evolution Pattern signiﬁes the leap to a higher level of complexity. It is one
aspect of the more foundational Pattern, Creativity. Evolution illustrates the
discontinuity a system undergoes as it makes the transformation to a qualitatively
higher level of development. The shift to higher vertical levels of complexity must
be balanced with horizontal adaptations at existing levels. The role of evolution is
